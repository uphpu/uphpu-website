<p>We've changed venues for this meeting! Please see below!</p>

<h2 id="talk-description">Talk Description</h2>

<p>There are various access control models, each with a specific intent and purpose. Determining the ideal model for an application can help ensure proper authorization to application resources. Each of the primary models will be covered, including the MAC, DAC, RBAC, and ABAC Access Control models. Examples, challenges, and benefits of each will be discussed to provide a further insight into which solution may best serve an application. Application sensitivity, regulations, and privacy may drive which model is selected.</p>

<h2 id="the-after-party">The After Party</h2>

<p>The After Party will be at the traditional location of Applebee's in Draper. We typically head over there at about 8:30-9:00, so watch Twitter and we'll announce when we're heading over.</p>

<h2 id="meeting-venue%3A-vivint-%40-thanksgiving-point">Meeting Venue: Vivint @ Thanksgiving Point</h2>

<p>The Meetings have moved! We are now meeting at the Vivint offices at Thanksgiving Point. Their address is:</p>

<p>Vivint<br/>
3401 Ashton Blvd<br/>
Lehi, Utah 84043</p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-there%3A">How to get there:</h3>

<p>The address is 3401 Ashton Blvd, though some mapping tools put that a little far down the street (if so, try 2719 Ashton Blvd instead). It's the first office building south of the intersection, nearest to the Dickeys BBQ on the corner.</p>

<p>Just come in the front door and we'll be on the first floor, to the right.</p>

<p>The front door will be locked, but there's a guard on duty right inside that can let folks in, and we're really close to the front door, so we should be able to help people get in pretty easily.</p>

<p>If you can't get in, call 801-391-8249 and we'll get you in!</p>

<p>Look forward to seeing everyone on Thursday!</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Justin Carmony</p>
