            <p>The generosity and support that pours out to our group never ceases to amaze me. Once again, in our hour of need, some of the most wonderful and unexpected individuals have stepped up and taken care of us, often even before we realized we needed it.</p>

<p>We would like to take a moment to report on the progress of our project and to publicly thank everyone that has so graciously contributed. To-date, we have received almost a hundred dollars in donations from our members. I am thrilled to announce that with this a server has been purchased. Installation and configuration is nearly complete and it will be online very shortly. We have been able to acquire hardware that will serve us well for some time. Several offers for donated or subsidized rack space and bandwidth have also been given. The invitation from UVNet has been selected and we will begin calling their data center in Orem our new home within a few days. We have also received much assistance in planning, preparation, and execution of the overall project from local businesses, organization, members, and friends of the group.</p>

<p>Specifically, we would like to thank the following for their support or donations:</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p><i>Adam Olsen, Beau Scott, Brady Mitchell, <a href="http://www.serverserv.com/">Computer Admin, LLC</a>, Fluidtiger.com, Gary Thornock, Jared Smith, Jonathan Duncan, John Anderson, Ken Williams, Lonnie Olson, Mac Newbold, Ray Hunter, <a href="twinpeakstech.com">Twin Peaks Technology, LLC</a>, <a href="http://www.uvnet.net/">UVNET, Inc.</a>, <a href="http://webpipe.net/">Webpipe.net, Inc.</a>, <a href="http://xmission.com/">XMission</a>.</i></p>

<p>We would also like to announce that UVNet has just been selected as an additional official mirror for php.net! We are thrilled about this new formed friendship, excited about their interest in our group and PHP, and look forward to working with them in the future. We encourage everyone to recommend them to clients and to look to them for any collocation or ISP needs that you may have.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we thank everyone for the outpouring of support and for the wonderful community that we have. Please take a moment to send in both your donation (if you have not yet and would still like to do so) and your comments on ideas you have for the group or ways in which we can better serve you.</p>
