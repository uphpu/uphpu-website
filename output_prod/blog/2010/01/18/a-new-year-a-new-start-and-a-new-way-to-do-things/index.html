            <p>Being in my seat, I've heard from many people over the course of this past year who have lost / changed employment.  I know there is concern by many who are employed as to what will happen long term. The reality of the matter is this, though.  Recession or no, change happens and the best way to be ready for it is to have a great skill set.  To that end, we are<br />
restructuring the way our meetings will be.</p>

<h4>New Meeting Structure</h4>

<p>We will be splitting our PHP meetings into 2 parts.  First part is basic skills / best practices training.  This is for you new guys who want to learn, but don't know where to start.  This section is called PHP fundamentals and will be hosted by Justin Carmony.  He and I are working on some printed materials and are ramping this up as we speak.  We also have several very senior and tenured members who are VERY friendly to questions. The second portion of our meeting will be a more advanced topic that will be of benefit to intermediate / advanced members, but will still be of great benefit to those who are new.</p>

<h4>Still Social!</h4>

<p>For those interested in the social aspect of our meeting, we still have the famous UPHPU Afterhours party.</p>

<h4>Resources</h4>

<p>As far as learning resources, Ray Hunter and I are working on having books available at our meetings.  While we will have some fun / zany way of handing out the books, there is an understood condition of receiving the book.  You MUST write a review of the book and post it online.  If you don't want to write a review, don't take the book.  I will be breaking arms on this!</p>

<h4>Online Resources</h4>

<p>I know that our recordings have been sporadic.  i'm working on allocating more time to this.</p>
