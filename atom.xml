            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Though it is slightly old news, I thought we should announce that we have a new website for UPHPU! The great thing
is that it is statically generate, meaning that it is very easy to have anyone contribute. All of the code is up on
<a href="https://github.com/uphpu/uphpu-website">uphpu-website GitHub repo</a> and you can easily create a fork, make some changes,
and submit a pull request.</p>

<p>While the new design looks awesome, I'm still trying to finish all of the little pages across the site. So if you have
some time, feel free to hit me up on the IRC channel and ask for any things that need to be done.</p>

<p>Thanks,

<p><strong>Talk Summary</strong></p>

<p>"Lets set aside the buzzword for a moment and have an honest discussion about DevOps. There is the idea of putting more Dev into Ops, but just a crucial (if not more crucial) is getting your Devs to think more like Ops. Most developers have little to no experience dealing with production environments, and helping them add value to your DevOps efforts can be difficult.</p>

<p>"We'll discuss practical ways of mentoring Devs into more DevOps skills and responsibilities. We'll share past experiences &amp; ways to help your Devs gain more insight to the health of production. Ultimately, our goal is to help your Devs gain the skills to help your team achieve better application performance &amp; uptimes. Finally, we'll talk about how Salt can play a major role in increasing insight in your production environment for your Devs."</p>

<p>I work for DDM, been involved with the Utah PHP Usergroup for about 5 years now, and I use PHP on a daily basis. Currently at work we operate KSL.com, DeseretNews.com, Ok.com, and many others.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Everyone, I can't believe it, but this January will mark 10 years of UPHPU meetings! We're so excited, we're having a little bit of a special meeting for the occasion!</p>

<p>The meeting will be this Thursday (Jan. 16th) at Needle at 7:00 PM. It'll be Elizabeth Naramore from GitHub talking about "GitHub: More than Just Code." We will also me slightly modifying the after party location for this month, so read on for the details.</p>

<p><strong>Talk Summary</strong></p>

<p>"It's no secret that at GitHub, we use GitHub to write the code that runs GitHub. But what you may not know is that we also use GitHub to manage GitHub the company. In this talk, I'll show you practical ways that we use our own system in a non-code context. You'll learn how we track projects and to-do lists, discuss and collaborate on corporate policies, communicate news to a highly distributed company, coordinate events, update and collaborate on internal and external documentation, and even onboard new Hubbers. You'll come away from this talk with a whole new perspective on using GitHub."</p>

<p><strong>About Elizabeth Naramore</strong></p>

<p>Elizabeth is an author, speaker, mentor, and recovering PHP developer. She currently works on the Community Team at GitHub, and loves finding new solutions to old problems.</p>

<p>After Party:  Belgian Waffle &amp; Omelet Inn 9:00 PM</p>

<p>For this meeting only, we'll be moving the after party to the Belgian Waffle &amp; Omelet Inn in Midvale (details &amp; map: https://www.skiphp.com/mingle/waffle) I also believe that the food will be covered by Jared Smith from Blue Host, who is one of the original members from back in the day. :)</p>

<p><strong>Ski PHP</strong></p>

<p>You've all likely have heard that Utah is having it's first regional PHP conference, Ski PHP! (https://www.skiphp.com/) It is great to see how awesome our community has grown over the last 10 years, and that our user group is one of the oldest PHP user groups today. If you haven't had a chance to sign up to attend, I highly recommend you give it a shot.</p>

There are many fast data stores, and then there is Redis. Learn about this excellent NoSQL solution that is a powerful in-memory key-value store. Learn how to solve traditionally difficult problems with Redis, and how you can benefit from 100,000 reads/writes a second on commodity hardware. We'll discuss how and when to use the different datatypes and commands to fit your needs. We'll discuss the different PHP libraries with their pros and cons. We'll then show some live examples on we use Redis at work to handle large volumes of data that is constantly being updated. Time permitting we'll end with a live benchmark of Redis to see just how many Req/s we can do.

<p>Talk summary: </p>

<blockquote><p>
For many years, we've been building web applications in more or less the same way. The tools have changed, but the architecture has mostly remained the same. Single page applications are a newer approach that can simplify your development and provide a better user experience, especially for mobile devices. This talk discusses what single page apps are, how you build one, and lessons learned in a team that has built several in a variety of different ways. We will also discuss the role that Javascript MVVM frameworks can play in Single Page Applications.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Mac Newbold has been involved in the Utah Open Source scene for a very long time, and previously was our Utah PHP Usergroup President. He currently is a Principle Developer at Vivint. To be honest, he is a pretty darn smart guy and always gives a good presentation. :) </p>

Whether it is a PHP Library, Editor, Debugger, or even favorite git command, it'll be a chance to see what people find useful while working with PHP. So if you have anything interesting to share, please feel free to show it off and talk just a little bit about why it is awesome.</p>
