            <p>Hey Everyone! Because SkiPHP is in town this week, we've moved the meeting from the 3rd Thursday to the 2nd Thursday! The wonderful Davey Shafik from Akami Technologies will be giving a talk on the future of HTTP/2 and Asynchronous APIs! This will be hosted at Vivint at Thanksgiving Point!</p>

<h2 id="skiphp">SkiPHP</h2>

<p>We're down to the wire to sign up to attend SkiPHP! It is this Thursday &amp; Friday and you can use the coupon code "UPHPU-LATE" to sign up for only $179!</p>

<h2 id="talk%3A-http%2F2-and-asynchronous-apis">Talk: HTTP/2 and Asynchronous APIs</h2>

<p>HTTP/2 (H2) is coming, and along with it a whole new way of communicating over the web. Connection re-use, prioritization, multiplexing, and server push are just some of the features in H2.</p>

<p>In this talk we'll look at the HTTP/2 protocol, and at how we can use asynchronous request now with HTTP/1.x. We will also look at what asychronous requests and H2 mean for your API and clients in the future.</p>

<h2 id="venue%3A-vivint">Venue: Vivint</h2>

<p>Vivint<br/>
3401 Ashton Blvd<br/>
Lehi, Utah 84043</p>

<p>How to get there:</p>

<p>The address is 3401 Ashton Blvd, though some mapping tools put that a little far down the street (if so, try 2719 Ashton Blvd instead). It's the first office building south of the intersection, nearest to the Dickeys BBQ on the corner.</p>

<p>Just come in the front door and we'll be on the first floor, to the right.</p>

<p>The front door will be locked, but there's a guard on duty right inside that can let folks in, and we're really close to the front door, so we should be able to help people get in pretty easily.</p>

<p>If you can't get in, call 801-391-8249 and we'll get you in!</p>

<p>Look forward to seeing everyone on Thursday!</p>
