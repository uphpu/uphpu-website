            <p>We have an awesome meeting lined up for this Thursday (July 17th) at Needle at 7:00 PM. First off we'll have a quick
introduction (about 10 to 15 minutes) on <a href="https://apigility.org/">Apigility</a> by H Hatfield. Then we'll have our
main presentation by Eric Berry talking about <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a> and integrating it into your PHP
Applications. Single Page Apps and JavaScript frameworks have been a huge
topic and trend for the last year or two, and this is a great opportunity to come hear about one of the main ones.</p>

<h4 id="about-apigility">About Apigility</h4>

<p>From the Apigility Website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Creating APIs for your applications shouldn't be hard.</p>
  
  <p>Apigility is an API Builder, designed to simplify creating and maintaining useful, easy to consume, and well
  structured APIs. Regardless of your experience in API building, with Apigility you can build APIs that enable
  mobile apps, developer communities, and any other consumer controlled access to your applications.</p>
  
  <p>Apigility can be used to implement APIs in PHP. We developed Apigility using Zend Framework 2, but this doesn't
  mean you have to use this framework to develop your API. You can use Apigility in any PHP application, using all
  the libraries and frameworks that you want.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="presenter%3A-h-hatfield">Presenter: H Hatfield</h4>

<p>Since H still hasn't given me his Bio, I'll give it for him! H is the Director of Development for Deseret Digital Media
on the Marketplace team. He oversees many of KSL.com's sites such as KSL Deals, KSL Jobs, KSL Local, Utah.com, and
several others. Yes, his whole first name is spelt with a single character, "H", and he is normally pretty busy trying
to keep up with his twin toddlers at home. He is also a pretty good guy.</p>

<h2 id="main-presentation%3A-ember%2C-php%2C-and-ponies">Main Presentation: Ember, PHP, and Ponies</h2>

<h4 id="talk-summary">Talk Summary</h4>

<p>"Ember is an amazing front-end javascript framework for creating ambitious web applications upon any backend system.
I will discuss how to get started using Ember and how to integrate it into your PHP applications."</p>

<h4 id="presenter%3A-eric-berry">Presenter: Eric Berry</h4>

<p>Eric has been developing web applications since 1999, focusing on PHP, Java, Groovy/Grails and Ruby on Rails. Eric is
the author of <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596520700/">Rails Pocket Reference</a>. He also spear-headed
<a href="http://teachmetocode.com/articles/the-teachmetocode-story/">TeachMeToCode.com</a>. He is a contributor in the
redesign and implementation of the <a href="http://www.grails.org/">Grails.org</a> website. He has contributed to the
Ember project website and has spoken on many occasions advocating Ember.</p>

<h2 id="the-after-party">The After Party</h2>

<p>The After Party will be at the traditional location of Applebee's in Draper. We typically head over there at about
8:30-9:00, so watch Twitter and we'll announce when we're heading over.</p>
