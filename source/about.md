title: About the Utah PHP Usergroup

---

UPHPU began in 2003 to connect members of the PHP community in Utah.

Everyone is welcome to our monthly meetings to network and learn about PHP and related technologies.

Speakers are welcome to submit ideas.

The current UPHPU President is Mark Niebergall. He can be found on Twitter at @mbniebergall or UTOS Slack at mbniebergall.
