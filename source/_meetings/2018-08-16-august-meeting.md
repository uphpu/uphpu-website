We all want our code to be simple, but achieving simplicity can be very tricky. While Object Oriented Programming has helped numerous people wrap their heads around programming, it has also given many enough rope to tangle themselves in code.

In his book, Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices, Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) talks about how to keep your code simple and easier to maintain by implementing S.O.L.I.D. Learn how these language agnostic principles make it easy for you to develop software that is easy to maintain and extend.
