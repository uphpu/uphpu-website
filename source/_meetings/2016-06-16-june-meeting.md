## Talk: Cryptography With PHP

The IT security landscape is littered with events where cryptography was not properly used, leading to leaked sensitive data and major problems for organizations. Learn how to encrypt and hash data using cryptography features in PHP, including password hashing, mcrypt, openssl, cracklib, and CSPRNG. Refresh on current industry standards, review cryptographic algorithms, and discuss concepts including password salts, algorithm costs, and attacks from timing, brute force, and rainbow tables.

## Venue: Vivint

Vivint<br/>
3401 Ashton Blvd<br/>
Lehi, Utah 84043

How to get there:

The address is 3401 Ashton Blvd, though some mapping tools put that a little far down the street (if so, try 2719 Ashton Blvd instead). It's the first office building south of the intersection, nearest to the Dickeys BBQ on the corner.

Just come in the front door and we'll be on the first floor, to the right.

The front door will be locked, but there's a guard on duty right inside that can let folks in, and we're really close to the front door, so we should be able to help people get in pretty easily.

If you can't get in, call 801-391-8249 and we'll get you in!

## The After Party

We will be going to JCW's for the After Party. Come check it out with us. @JustinCarmony will tweet out when we head over from the venue to go eat in case you will be coming late!

Look forward to seeing everyone on Thursday!
