Technology moves fast, and a busy PHP developer has their hands full keeping up within their own ecosystem: Nginx, PHP-FPM, XDebug, REST, OWASP, TheCloud, PSR-X, interfaces, traits, Composer, Packagist... it is hard to keep track of it all! Outside of PHP, a little-known language called Javascript has become a BIG DEALâ„¢. We will discuss the changes that have made JS fun again, both on the client and the server. A brief look into the why, what, and how of ECMAScript 2015.

### About Matthew Hill

Matthew Hill has been an itinerant hacker-for-hire for a few years. He currently enjoys writing REST consumers (nom-nom), building Cloud solutions, and experimenting with Raspberry Pis. He hopes one day to catch up with an ever-growing Steam backlog.

There will also be a few other items to handout.

## Venue: Vivint

Vivint<br/>
3401 Ashton Blvd<br/>
Lehi, Utah 84043

How to get there:

The address is 3401 Ashton Blvd, though some mapping tools put that a little far down the street (if so, try 2719 Ashton Blvd instead). It's the first office building south of the intersection, nearest to the Dickeys BBQ on the corner.

Just come in the front door and we'll be on the first floor, to the right.

The front door will be locked, but there's a guard on duty right inside that can let folks in, and we're really close to the front door, so we should be able to help people get in pretty easily.

If you can't get in, call 801-391-8249 and we'll get you in!

## The After Party

We will be going to JCW's for the After Party. Come check it out with us.

Look forward to seeing everyone on Thursday!
