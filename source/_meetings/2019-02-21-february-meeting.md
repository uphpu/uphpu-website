A long time ago, it wasn’t smart to run PHP daemons. Memory management issues made long-running processes impractical, and PHP "daemons" were often just frequently-restarted cron jobs. Since PHP 5, it’s become more and more common to use PHP from the command line, and some are even brave enough to daemonize their PHP scripts. We’ll discuss different useful ways to run PHP from the command line, and why you should be using it in your infrastructure.
