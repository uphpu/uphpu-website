We will be meeting at Vivint in Lehi by Thanksgiving Point.

## CSS Magic - The art of declarative styles

This will be an intimate session covering the secret teachings about the dark arts of CSS. Travis will be guiding a group discussion about the powerful transmutation techniques available for today's front-end mages. If you are in search of answers for troubling styling problems, or simply wanting to take part in the conversation… please join us!

## Travis Barney

Travis Barney is a UI Engineer at Vivint, specializing in front-end applications and delighting customers with innovative experiences. He spends his days and evenings in front of a laptop, tinkering with shiny new javascript frameworks and miraculously sustains the stamina required to avoid fatigue. His home is bustling with his wife, son, three cats, three dogs, three fish, and a hamster (who he recently re-discovered hiding behind the fridge).

## Pizza!

Utah Open Source (UTOS) will be providing pizza at the beginning of the meetup. Thank you UTOS!

## Swag Alert

At the end of the presentation, one random lucky winner will win a free 1 year individual subscription to any single JetBrains Toolbox product. Choices includes PhpStorm, WebStorm, DataGrip, or others seen at https://www.jetbrains.com/products.html. Thanks JetBrains!

## Venue: Vivint

Vivint<br/>
3401 Ashton Blvd<br/>
Lehi, Utah 84043

How to get there:

The address is 3401 Ashton Blvd, though some mapping tools put that a little far down the street (if so, try 2719 Ashton Blvd instead). It's the first office building south of the intersection, nearest to the Dickeys BBQ on the corner.

Just come in the front door and we'll be on the first floor, to the right.

The front door will be locked, but there's a guard on duty right inside that can let folks in, and we're really close to the front door, so we should be able to help people get in pretty easily.

If you can't get in, call 801-391-8249 and we'll get you in!

## The After Party

We will be going to JCW's for the After Party. Come check it out with us.

Look forward to seeing everyone on Thursday!
