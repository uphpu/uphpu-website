The design and implementation of GraphQL for Doctrine using Hydrators, Filters and Strategies. This talk also covers creating your own GraphQL implementation for data sources other than Doctrine
leveraging webonyx/graphql-php.

Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wgdKLBkSrhi8rZWninfi-4aqHyRzEBEwYC5TEEzxKcw/edit#slide=id.g3f96d80148_0_0

Message from the speaker: My talk will include taking an existing database https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/ and https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db and aliasing an ORM over the database without changing it (See https://employees.apiskeletons.com/erd.pdf) then enabling GraphQL on the data. To see this in action please use Chromiql https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromeiql/fkkiamalmpiidkljmicmjfbieiclmeij?hl=en and set your endpoint to https://employees.apiskeletons.com/graphql

I will go through these steps in detail during my talk but wanted to give those interested a head-start by giving access to the GraphQL endpoint created.
