The gunslinger age of writing any code that works is long gone. PSR coding standards are now available as guidelines for writing legible code your peers can also read and work with. We will be exploring all the coding guidelines available in squizlabs/php_codesniffer and creating our own coding standard repository which can be applied to any project.
