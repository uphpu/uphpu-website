So you went to a presentation on Test Driven Development and you were really excited to get back to work and start using it in your development. Then you get to work and you are given a project to do so you sit down and create a new test class. Now what? What should my first test do? How do I know what to write tests for if I'm not even sure what exactly the code is going to be doing? How do I take the example the presenter gave of building a simple class with TDD and actually use that in my workflow where I am working with an entire system instead of a simple class? These are just some of the struggles I have had while trying to use TDD in my everyday work. In this presentation we will work through some of the initial steps of building a site to track accomplishments using TDD. We will be using Laravel and some of the built-in testing functionality it gives you but the presentation will concentrate more on the process then the tools.

## Venue: Vivint

Vivint<br/>
3401 Ashton Blvd<br/>
Lehi, Utah 84043

How to get there:

The address is 3401 Ashton Blvd, though some mapping tools put that a little far down the street (if so, try 2719 Ashton Blvd instead). It's the first office building south of the intersection, nearest to the Dickeys BBQ on the corner.

Just come in the front door and we'll be on the first floor, to the right.

The front door will be locked, but there's a guard on duty right inside that can let folks in, and we're really close to the front door, so we should be able to help people get in pretty easily.

If you can't get in, call 801-391-8249 and we'll get you in!

## The After Party

We will be going to JCW's for the After Party. Come check it out with us.

Look forward to seeing everyone on Thursday!
