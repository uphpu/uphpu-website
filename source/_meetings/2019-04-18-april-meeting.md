Attacks occur at an alarming rate and frequency against every online application. Creating effective counter-measures takes creativity coupled with proven techniques. From DoS to password cracking to injection attacks, see actual PHP code an attacker could use to launch attacks, and learn what works and what does not to prevent attacks from succeeding. Warning: this session will include live coding and attacks on pre-approved targets, do not try without approval from target systems first.

If you'd like to try code out or share hacking ideas, please bring a laptop to do that.
