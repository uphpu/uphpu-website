Given the prominence/rise of API-first development when developing web applications, projects then need to be tested beyond unit and functional tests. Authoring tests using the Gherkin language with Behat provides a way to achieve BDD to test APIs. We'll dive right into writing Gherkin, how to create your own scenarios in Gherkin, and how to hook those tests up with custom PHP test methods. See tests in action with live coding and live demos, including writing new tests. Leave excited to produce fully-tested APIs!
