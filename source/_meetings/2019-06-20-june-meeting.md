Most developers are developers, not DBAs, yet many smaller companies have inadequate database experience in-house. This is largely because databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL don’t necessarily require a full-time DBA to administer. It’s become more important for developers at smaller companies to have some basic knowledge of how to keep their database happy.

He also runs one of the largest independent online communities of college sports fans. In the past, he ran the Ski PHP Conference, assisted with the OpenWest Conference, was a core team member of the Utah Open Source Foundation, and ran the Provo Linux User Group.
