The first part of an engineer's career is pretty straight-forward: learning the skills and technology to code. Then, one day after being a senior developer for a few years, you find you need to make a decision: do you want to become a manager? Are you ready to make the switch to management? Do you even want to? What would it be like? How do you know if you're ready? How do you prepare? Ahhhhh!

Take a deep breath: it's okay. It is possible to make a switch to engineering management and still have a fulfilling job. We'll discuss the basics of being an engineering manager, what it's like to make the switch, and how to prepare for it. We'll discuss techniques you can use to be successful, as well as common pitfalls you can run into. So whether you're an engineer looking to prepare for the possibility in the future, or a seasoned manager looking for some ways to improve (since we all can improve), come learn from Justin's experience helping mentor engineers for leadership and management roles.
