Debugging in PHP can be tedious and prone to error when using var_dump and echo statements. Learn how to debug more effectively and get better insight into an application by using Xdebug. See how to setup PhpStorm, Xdebug, and the browser to enable debugging that will let you step into code and see variable values live. Extend those debugging capabilities into cli, APIs, and SOAP clients to increase the code that can be debugged with ease.
