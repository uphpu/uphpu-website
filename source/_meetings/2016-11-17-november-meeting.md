## Freelancing and Money: How to Pitch, How to Charge, And Make More Money

Money is one of the primary reasons for freelancing, but most of us are doing it wrong. As a result, we lose out on some of the things that money can buy. Some of these are freedom, security, and peace of mind. So let’s fix that. In this seminar, we’ll cover some key lessons that will change the way you look at side projects and freelance gigs. 

Specifically, we’ll cover:
 - Why time has little correlation with value (and the Wizard of Schenectady).
 - The different ways of billing (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, fixed, and value).
 - Proposing different options, and giving customers reasons to pay you more.
 - Finding out the value of a project by using NDA’s.
 - What other people are charging (an interactive group activity), and why that doesn’t have to matter.
 - Becoming a top-tier consultant and beyond.
 - The mind-shifts that will get you there.
 - Any random questions you might have.

And as you implement these lessons a number of things will happen: You’ll make more on projects. You’ll be able to work less. You’ll have more time to spend with your family to do the things that you want to do. Most of all, you’ll become more than just a developer. You’ll become a high-end consultant who just happens to use a computer to solve business problems. And though it’s just a label, it’s an important label that comes with a high price-tag.

## Venue: Vivint

Vivint<br/>
3401 Ashton Blvd<br/>
Lehi, Utah 84043

How to get there:

The address is 3401 Ashton Blvd, though some mapping tools put that a little far down the street (if so, try 2719 Ashton Blvd instead). It's the first office building south of the intersection, nearest to the Dickeys BBQ on the corner.

Just come in the front door and we'll be on the first floor, to the right.

The front door will be locked, but there's a guard on duty right inside that can let folks in, and we're really close to the front door, so we should be able to help people get in pretty easily.

If you can't get in, call 801-391-8249 and we'll get you in!

## The After Party

We will be going to JCW's for the After Party. Come check it out with us.

Look forward to seeing everyone on Thursday!
