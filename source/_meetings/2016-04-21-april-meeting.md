summary: |
    If you've been involved in development very long, you've probably experienced some projects that ended up being painful and less successful than you wanted. I've definitely had my share. Through good advice, study, and a large helping of trial and error, I've also managed to have some projects that exceeded my expectations. I've learned some lessons the hard way, and in some cases, stumbled upon some techniques that I think work really well.

### Talk Summary

If you've been involved in development very long, you've probably experienced some projects that ended up being painful and less successful than you wanted. I've definitely had my share. Through good advice, study, and a large helping of trial and error, I've also managed to have some projects that exceeded my expectations. I've learned some lessons the hard way, and in some cases, stumbled upon some techniques that I think work really well.

This talk will share some ideas, suggestions, and techniques that I have found correlate highly with success, and some that are highly correlated with pain and/or failure. 

### Presenter: Mac Newbold

Mac Newbold is, well, just plain old awesome. I forgot to ask him for a bio, so I guess I'll fill this part out myself. ;) Mac has been working at Vivint as one of their Directors for a project called "Tech Genie." Before that he was the co-founder and CTO for Code Greene. He also has an awesome name that sounds like a font.

### Venue: Vivint

Vivint<br/>
3401 Ashton Blvd<br/>
Lehi, Utah 84043

How to get there:

The address is 3401 Ashton Blvd, though some mapping tools put that a little far down the street (if so, try 2719 Ashton Blvd instead). It's the first office building south of the intersection, nearest to the Dickeys BBQ on the corner.

Just come in the front door and we'll be on the first floor, to the right.

The front door will be locked, but there's a guard on duty right inside that can let folks in, and we're really close to the front door, so we should be able to help people get in pretty easily.

If you can't get in, call 801-391-8249 and we'll get you in!

## The After Party

We will be going to CJW's for the After Party. Come check it out with us. @JustinCarmony will tweet out when we head over from the venue to go eat in case you will be coming late!

Look forward to seeing everyone on Thursday!
