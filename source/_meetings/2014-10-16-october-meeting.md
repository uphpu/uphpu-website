For October's meeting our presenter will be the one, the only...
me. :) I'll be giving a talk I gave at the Dutch PHP Conference
in Amsterdam on "Agile for Developers", or the unofficial title
of "How to make Agile not suck." :)

## Talk Description

Almost everyone in our industry has heard of agile development,
scrum, and likely to some degree. Most teams I know follow some
sort of scrum-like process: two week sprints, story points,
estimation, etc. However, it is very easy to go through the
motions of scrum & agile without really improving the process,
and that was the struggle our different different development
teams faced at DDM. However, over the last two years across our
different teams we’ve discovered very key elements of scrum that
are rarely talked about that make the biggest difference.

So in this talk we’ll assume you’ve heard of scrum, sprints,
scrummasters, backlogs, and the general idea of scrum. In
this talk, we’ll go through the key changes we made in our
agile process across our different teams that really made
the difference. We’ll show how we were able to change scrum
from a set of meetings and to-do lists into an effective
system that has double our teams’ output.
