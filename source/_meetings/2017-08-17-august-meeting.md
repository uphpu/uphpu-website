## Coding Standards and Unit Testing - Why, When, and A Little Bit of How by Brian Rogers 

Have you ever merged in code only to find out later that it broke a seemingly unrelated portion of the application? Do your merge requests get overwhelming because of differing opinions on how things should be formatted? Have you ever wondered how you can get unit testing as a part of your workflow without torches and pitchforks being brandished? I've got stories to tell from lessons learned both the easy way and the hard way. I'll show you what you can do, when you can do it, and most importantly why it matters. 

### About Brian Rogers

I'm Brian Rogers. I used to work for other companies helping them build great things, mostly APIs that were managed with Laravel and served content to browsers and mobile apps. I've gone from the bottom of the ladder to the leader of teams because I had some great mentors that not only taught me directly but gave me opportunities to learn on my own with the goal of teaching my mentors. I'm now a freelancer where I get to write code and consult on various topics ranging from how to architect an API, developing workflows and standards for teams, and a little bit of DevOps. 

## Pizza!

## Venue: Vivint

Vivint<br/>
3401 Ashton Blvd<br/>
Lehi, Utah 84043

How to get there:

The address is 3401 Ashton Blvd, though some mapping tools put that a little far down the street (if so, try 2719 Ashton Blvd instead). It's the first office building south of the intersection, nearest to the Dickeys BBQ on the corner.

Just come in the front door and we'll be on the first floor, to the right.

The front door will be locked, but there's a guard on duty right inside that can let folks in, and we're really close to the front door, so we should be able to help people get in pretty easily.

If you can't get in, call 801-391-8249 and we'll get you in!

## The After Party

We will be going to JCW's for the After Party. Come check it out with us.

Look forward to seeing everyone on Thursday!
