Refactoring is not a random approach for code cleanup. Awareness to different code smells gives you indicators for refactoring. We always wonder about the what-where-when to refactor. While going through the code, we feel something is wrong, but not exactly sure what's wrong. How to maintain the balance of code cleanup vs. client priorities. A good takeaway would be awareness of different code smells and techniques to eliminate those smells.
