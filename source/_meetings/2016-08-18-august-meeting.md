## Talk: Object Relational Mapping and it's place in APIs

Object Relational Mapping has proven superior to SQL query based applications.  Advantages include building your database from the ORM metadata and the ability to traverse the database using objects.  An overview of why ORM is better then specific aspects of ORM such as the Query Builder will give the attendee a realistic understanding of the technology.

## Venue: Vivint

Vivint<br/>
3401 Ashton Blvd<br/>
Lehi, Utah 84043

How to get there:

The address is 3401 Ashton Blvd, though some mapping tools put that a little far down the street (if so, try 2719 Ashton Blvd instead). It's the first office building south of the intersection, nearest to the Dickeys BBQ on the corner.

Just come in the front door and we'll be on the first floor, to the right.

The front door will be locked, but there's a guard on duty right inside that can let folks in, and we're really close to the front door, so we should be able to help people get in pretty easily.

If you can't get in, call 801-391-8249 and we'll get you in!

## The After Party

We will be going to JCW's for the After Party. Come check it out with us. @mbniebergall will tweet out when we head over from the venue to go eat in case you will be coming late!

Look forward to seeing everyone on Thursday!
