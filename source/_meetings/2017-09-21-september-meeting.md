## PHP TestFest 2017

We will be participating in the world-wide PHP TestFest 2017 event by learning how to write tests for PHP using PHP and submitting tests. Please join us for this unique opportunity to contribute to PHP!

## Pizza!

Our sponsor Microsoft Technical Communities is providing food! There will be pizza, drinks, and even desserts delivered from Dominos.

## Swag Alert

At the end of the presentation, one random lucky winner will win a free 1 year individual subscription to any single JetBrains Toolbox product. Choices includes PhpStorm, WebStorm, DataGrip, or others seen at https://www.jetbrains.com/products.html. Thanks JetBrains!

## Venue: Vivint

Vivint<br/>
3401 Ashton Blvd<br/>
Lehi, Utah 84043

How to get there:

The address is 3401 Ashton Blvd, though some mapping tools put that a little far down the street (if so, try 2719 Ashton Blvd instead). It's the first office building south of the intersection, nearest to the Dickeys BBQ on the corner.

Just come in the front door and we'll be on the first floor, to the right.

The front door will be locked, but there's a guard on duty right inside that can let folks in, and we're really close to the front door, so we should be able to help people get in pretty easily.

If you can't get in, call 801-391-8249 and we'll get you in!

## The After Party

We will be going to JCW's for the After Party. Come check it out with us.

Look forward to seeing everyone on Thursday!
