Some developers love them, others hate them. Some use it to define what type of developer they are. Some only want to work with one in particular, or refuse to work with one in particular. They can either bring an office together or divide developers into tribal groups. Let's look at what constitutes a framework, why they can be so polarizing, and when you should consider (or not consider) using a framework.
