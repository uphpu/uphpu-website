## Data Types in PHP

Correctly understanding the eight data types in PHP is essential to a solid foundation in development. Come refresh your knowledge of the scalar types, compound types, and special data types used in PHP, and learn about proper usage of each. Review type juggling, learn some common data type traps to avoid, and how to code defensively to prevent having the data type of a variable change unexpectedly. Finally learn how unit tests can help verify that code is handling data types correctly.

## Venue: Vivint

Vivint<br/>
3401 Ashton Blvd<br/>
Lehi, Utah 84043

How to get there:

The address is 3401 Ashton Blvd, though some mapping tools put that a little far down the street (if so, try 2719 Ashton Blvd instead). It's the first office building south of the intersection, nearest to the Dickeys BBQ on the corner.

Just come in the front door and we'll be on the first floor, to the right.

The front door will be locked, but there's a guard on duty right inside that can let folks in, and we're really close to the front door, so we should be able to help people get in pretty easily.

If you can't get in, call 801-391-8249 and we'll get you in!

## The After Party

We will be going to JCW's for the After Party. Come check it out with us.

Look forward to seeing everyone on Thursday!
