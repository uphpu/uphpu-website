            <p>If you feel like your team could be more efficient in getting work delivered and out the door, take a look at Mob Programming. Woody Zuill coined the term Mob Programming as &quot;a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer.&quot; We&#039;ll talk about the principles and techniques used in Mob Programming and how to get started with your team. We’ll also do a short hands-on example to help you get a feel for if you’d like to try it with your team.

                <p>If you&#039;ve been involved in development very long, you&#039;ve probably experienced some projects that ended up being painful and less successful than you wanted. I&#039;ve definitely had my share. Through good advice, study, and a large helping of trial and error, I&#039;ve also managed to have some projects that exceeded my expectations. I&#039;ve learned some lessons the hard way, and in some cases, stumbled upon some techniques that I think work really well.

            <p>A <a href="http://aaronbarkerphotography.com/">friend</a> told me about <a href="http://stevesouders.com/">Steve Souders</a> yesterday. Steve works at Google and is the author of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow">YSlow</a>, the performance analysis extension to Firebug. My friend pointed me to a list of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html">performance "rules"</a> that Steve published and to a <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/ajax-experience-videos-performance-and-security">talk that he gave</a> (first one on the page) recently at a conference. If you are interested in web performance, this checklist and talk are not to be missed.</p>

<p>Two of the biggest things that I learned was to not use "@import" to link to style sheets and how to download javascript scripts in parallel.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/2008/12/13/zebra-striping-across-rowspan/">zebra striping across rowspans with jQuery</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>On one of my current projects, I am adding alternating shading ("zebra striping") to rows in a table with javascript. This last week I encountered a scenario where I needed this to work on a table that had some cells that spanned multiple rows.</p>

<p>My current script could not handle this as it was using jQuery's <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/odd">:odd</a> selector and I now needed to stripe all of the spanned rows together instead of just every other one. The additional shading that I was applying when hovering over the row was also broken as it too needed to shade all of the spanned rows instead of just the one the mouse was over.</p>

<p>So, I enhanced my script to work with both scenarios. I hope it can be of use to someone.</p>

<pre lang="php">
// check for rowspans
rows = $('.datatable > tbody > tr:first > td:first').attr('rowspan');
var rows_count = rows * 1;

// if, shade spanned rows; else, shade for every other row
if(rows_count > 1) {
   // find the row group leader
   function rgl(who) {
      var current = who;
      
      for(i = 0; i < rows_count; i++) {
         if($(current).find('td:first').attr('rowspan') > 1) {
            var rgl = current;
            break;
         }
         
         current = $(current).prev('tr');
      }
      
      return rgl;
   }

   // row shading
   for(r = 1; r <= rows_count; r++) {
      var nth = (rows_count * 2) + 'n+' + (rows_count + r);
      $('.datatable > tbody > tr:nth-child(' + nth + ')').addClass('odd');
   }
   
   // row hover shading
   $('.datatable > tbody > tr').hover(
      function() {
         var who = rgl(this);
         for(i = 0; i < rows_count; i++) {
            $(who).find('td').toggleClass('hover');
            who = $(who).next('tr');
         }
      },
      function() {
         var who = rgl(this);
         for(i = 0; i < rows_count; i++) {
            $(who).find('td').toggleClass('hover');
            who = $(who).next('tr');
         }
      }
   );
} else {
   $('.datatable > tbody > tr:odd').addClass('odd');
}

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I'm very pleased to announce the topic for November's UPHPU <a href="/events">Meeting</a>: Streamlined Web Development using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNC">VNC</a> and <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>.</p>

<p>Starting the meeting off will be <a href="http://codegreene.com/">Code Greene's</a> Kevin Carter.  <a href="http://dexterthedragon.com">Kevin</a>, who has used <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> in a production environment for several months now, will be presenting a primer on how to get started with Git.  Additionally, he'll cover the advantages of distrusted source code control and possibly some topics on using git in an svn eniroment.  His blog can be found at .</p>

<p>Following Kevin will be are main speaker, <a href="http://www.justincarmony.com/blog/">Justin Carmony</a>.  His presentation will focus on the  unique challenges with developing, deploying, & managing Website development. Justin Carmony has put together his trips, tricks, and suggestions for streamlining the development cycle. With a focus on automation, using SVN and Trac allows developers to focus on development rather than redundant tasks. Whether a small project with a single developer, or a large project with a big team, SVN and Trac in a LAMP environment can help any developer. Time permitting he will show some of his own live examples of using SVN & Trac. If you have a specific topics or questions you would like addressed in his presentation, please feel free to let him know on his blog.</p>

<p>Justin Carmony has worked in web development professionally for the last four years. With emphasis on PHP, .NET, and Web Services, he has worked on projects ranging from simple websites to complex communications between thousands of remote systems. He currently is working as an independent contractor & private consultant.</p>
