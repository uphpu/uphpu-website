            <p>&quot;Impostor syndrome can leave you feeling like you are a fraud and incompetent to be considered a professional in your chosen path. In reality, impostor syndrome is common and occurs when one struggles to internalize achievements and successes. Come feel a burden lifted when you realize that not only are you not an impostor, but you have actually succeeded in achieving something great. Hear about the experiences of others and how to overcome feeling like an impostor, and leave feeling confident in your accomplishments and skills.&quot;

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>We have an excellent presentation for this Thursday's meeting by Russell Ahlstrom: KSS &amp; PHP.</p>

<blockquote><p>KSS is a set of guidelines to help you produce an HTML styleguide tied to CSS documentation that is nice to read in plain text, yet structured enough to be automatically extracted and processed by a machine. It is designed with CSS preprocessors (such as SCSS or LESS) in mind, and flexible enough to accommodate a multitude of CSS frameworks (such as YUI, Blueprint or 960).</p>
<p>KSS-PHP is a php library that you can use to turn your KSS documented files into a living styleguide similar to Github's (<a href="https://github.com/styleguide/css">https://github.com/styleguide/css</a>). Styleguides are helpful for maintaining consistency across your sites, getting new developers up to speed, proving out new designs or additions, and ensuring changes or updates to your css don't break existing styles.</p>
<p>Russell is the Director of Web Development for Scan, a Provo based startup that connects the real world with the digital universe in fun and innovative ways. Previous to that, Russell worked as the Director of eCommerce Development at Deseret Digital Media, Senior Developer at Bloosky, Team Lead at BYU's Department of Continuing Education, and as a Web Development instructor at BYU.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our meeting will be held at 7:00PM at the Vinit Office's in Thanksgiving Point, and theÂ after partyÂ will be at Applebee's in Draper as usual. At this meeting we will be discussing venues as well.</p>

<p>the next light in about a block is Ashton Blvd/Maple Loop - turn left and about 3-4 blocks later, after the in-construction building, there's a road on the left right before the thanksgiving point complex starts,</p>
<p>that's executive parkway</p>
<p>you'll turn left there and we're the building on the left that is finished</p>
<p>come on in, 2nd floor</p></blockquote>

            <p>We're pleased to annouce that for FebruaryÂ we will have a presentation by Jon St. John, Director of Engineering for Drive Current. It will be this Thursday (February 21st, 2013) at 7:00 PM.Â <em><strong>We have also changed venues this year! So please check the details below!Â </strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Presentation on Selenium</strong></p>

<p>Jon will be presenting on Selenium, a tool for automating tests of websites. From Seleium's website:</p>

<blockquote><p>Selenium automates browsers. That's it. What you do with that power is entirely up to you. Primarily it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!) also be automated as well.</p>
<p>Selenium has the support of some of the largest browser vendors who have taken (or are taking) steps to make Selenium a native part of their browser. It is also the core technology in countless other browser automation tools, APIs and frameworks.</p></blockquote>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Everyone, we're going to start off the 2013 year with a great presentation from Dave Boucha. It will be this Thursday (January 17th, 2013) at 7:00 PM.Â <em><strong>We will also be changing venues! So please check the details below!Â </strong></em></p>

<p><strong></strong><strong>An Intro to Server Configuration and Remote Management with Salt</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Are you tired of repeatedly configuring each new server by hand? Is your current configuration management system driving you nuts and making you feel like you're in a straight jacket? Are you scared because that 5 year old mission critical server could have a hardware failure at any moment, yet nobody still working at your company has any idea what's on it or how to configure it?</p>
<p>Salt is designed to solve these problems and much much more. Â Manage one or two servers in a clean simple manner. Â Control 20,000 to 30,000 servers like a Sith Master! Â Duplicate your web server in a matter of minutes on the cloud of your choice. Â  Query available disk space on 100's of servers in a matter of a few seconds right from your CLI.</p>
<p>Easily create your own Salt modules to add functionality specific to your infrastructure and needs. Salt bends to your will! Use Salt's python api or rest api to give the power of Salt to your custom application.</p>
<p>And best of all, join Salt's huge and passionate community of users on the mailing list and #salt on <a href="http://irc.freenode.net/">irc.freenode.net</a>. Â Salt was the project with the 8th most unique code contributors on Github in 2012! (<a href="https://github.com/blog/1359-the-octoverse-in-2012">https://github.com/blog/1359-the-octoverse-in-2012</a>) Â Salt has a very welcoming and helpful community and is designed to make it very simple to contribute and participate.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>New Venue: Vivint Offices in Thanksgiving Point</strong></p>

<p>We'd like to thank C7 for hosting us for this last year &amp; excited to see their growth!Â Unfortunately, this means the conference room area we used for meetings is being converted into office spaces to handle their growth.</p>

<p>So the new venue will be at theÂ ThanksgivingÂ Point Vivint Offices, which is just one more exit south than C7. Here is the address:</p>

<p>2500 Executive Pkwy #200, Lehi, Utah 84043</p>

<p>Here is a link in Google Maps:</p>

<p>Here are the directions given by our very own Mac Newbold:</p>

<blockquote><p>Easiest way: get off I-15 at Timpanogos Highway (SR-92) and head west (right if you're coming from Draper, left if you came north through Lehi)</p>
<p>the next light in about a block is Ashton Blvd/Maple Loop - turn left and about 3-4 blocks later, after the in-construction building, there's a road on the left right before the thanksgiving point complex starts,</p>
<p>that's executive parkway</p>
<p>you'll turn left there and we're the building on the left that is finished</p>
<p>come on in, 2nd floor</p></blockquote>

<p>Look forward to seeing everyone Thursday night at 7:00 PM! Don't hesitate to let us know if you have any questions!</p>
