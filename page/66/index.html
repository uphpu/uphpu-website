            <p>If you&#039;ve been involved in development very long, you&#039;ve probably experienced some projects that ended up being painful and less successful than you wanted. I&#039;ve definitely had my share. Through good advice, study, and a large helping of trial and error, I&#039;ve also managed to have some projects that exceeded my expectations. I&#039;ve learned some lessons the hard way, and in some cases, stumbled upon some techniques that I think work really well.

            <h2><a href="/blog/2006/02/10/ajax-in-action/">Ajax in action</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>The book takes an excellent approach in explaining both how AJAX works, and how it can be wielded.  For example, the authors chose very practical and useful applications that developers could easily find themselves coding for a client.  Example projects include advanced HTML forms, type-ahead suggestions, a desktop interface, and search engine.</p>

<p>"Ajax is a growing new technology at the time of this writing and we're delighted to bring you the low down on it, in the inimitable style of Manning's In Action series.  In doing so, though, we faced an interesting problem.  Although Ajax is indisputably hot, it isn't rally new.  It isn't a really a technology, either..."</p>

<p>The advent of Rich Internet Applications is a result of a harmony of several web disciplines.  While there are several ways to create RIA, Ajax is certainly in the forefront. </p>

<p>While AJAX is the soup d'jour, the authors are also very caution to explain the security risks of AJAX and devoted a whole chapter to concerns you will want to consider.</p>

<p>This is my first experience with this publisher and these authors, but I found this book to be less rigid than many other technical books I have read.  Truth told, I felt the book was written more in a conversational style and was able to gleam more of the information I wanted easier and faster through their approach.</p>

<p>All things being equal, you should have a good understanding of JavaScript and XML before approaching AJAX in general.  I'm not saying you to have achieved Jedi Master status, but padawans may have some difficulty.</p>

<p>I'd recommend this book</p>

            <p>I just finished reading an article on Linux.com that talks about useful tools that a system administrator uses. This is a great article to read and glean if you are doing any system administration with your PHP development. At work and as a contractor I can only stress the importance that a developer needs to be familiar with system administration. You can check out the article <a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/01/17/2036214">here.</a></p>

<p>Here are some command line tools that i use almost on a daily bases to help out with system administration tasks.</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p></p>

<ul>
<li>find</li>
<li>xargs</li>
<li>sed</li>
<li>awk</li>
<li>nmap</li>
<li>netstat</li>
<li>bash shell scripting</li>
<li>column</li>
<li>expand</li>
<li>split</li>
<li>comm</li>
<li>sort</li>
<li>diff</li>
<li>dig</li>
<li>dsplit</li>
<li>du</li>
<li>df</li>
<li>free</li>
<li>grep</li>
<li>screen</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just some of the ones that I use. One point I would like to make is that by becoming familiar with additional commands you will start to become more proficient in your system admin tasks; obviously resulting in a sharper developer.</p>

            <p>There has been some recent activity on the PHP Developer mailing list about the addition of JSON into the PHP Core.  After reading the thread, I did a little research on JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). Here is a <a href="http://www.crockford.com/JSON/">great website</a> to read more about it.</p>
