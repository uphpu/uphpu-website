            <p>If you&#039;ve been involved in development very long, you&#039;ve probably experienced some projects that ended up being painful and less successful than you wanted. I&#039;ve definitely had my share. Through good advice, study, and a large helping of trial and error, I&#039;ve also managed to have some projects that exceeded my expectations. I&#039;ve learned some lessons the hard way, and in some cases, stumbled upon some techniques that I think work really well.

            <p>For our October <a href="/events">meeting</a>, Grant Shipley, from Redhat, will be flying in from North Carolina to<br />
tell us about deploying PHP on ec2 using openshift, and a little about www.follw.it which is a site he created using Code Igniter, and why he chose PHP over Java for the follw.it site, despite being a Java developer for over 10 years.</p>

<blockquote><p>Whether you have one or a million visitors accessing your web app,<br />
they are all going to demand a great user experience regardless of<br />
what it takes for you to deliver it. This invariably means quick page<br />
loads and fast response times every single time. When things go south,<br />
you just throw more hardware at the problem and increase your caches<br />
and buffers, right? Wrong. Toss in an infrastructure that resides on<br />
the cloud and now you've got a really interesting problem on your<br />
hands. I'll leave the marketecure slides at the door, this is a<br />
hands-on technical talk in which we'll deploy an application to the<br />
cloud and then turn up the heat by leveraging the right mix of<br />
elasticity and auto-sclaing.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Grant Shipley is an OpenShift PaaS Evangelist at Red Hat focused on<br />
cloud technologies.  Prior to that, Grant was a Manager of Software<br />
Development with responsibilities over the www.redhat.com website and<br />
supporting infrastructure.  Grant has over 10 years of software<br />
development experience focusing on Java and PHP.  In his free time, he<br />
contributes to several open source projects including Media Portal and<br />
www.follw.it  as well as developing iOS applications.  Grant has been<br />
using Linux on a daily basis since 1994 and is active in the FOSS<br />
community.</p></blockquote>
