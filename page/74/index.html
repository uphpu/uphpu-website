            <p>If you feel like your team could be more efficient in getting work delivered and out the door, take a look at Mob Programming. Woody Zuill coined the term Mob Programming as &quot;a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer.&quot; We&#039;ll talk about the principles and techniques used in Mob Programming and how to get started with your team. We’ll also do a short hands-on example to help you get a feel for if you’d like to try it with your team.

            <h2><a href="/blog/2005/06/20/thinking-object-oriented-2-of-5/">Thinking object-oriented (2 of 5)</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>&lt;</p>

<p>p>This is the second of five articles written on object-oriented programming.  These articles were originally written for <a href="http://www.jacwright.com/" title="Jac Wright, Web Development and Application Design">jacwright.com</a>  This article was going to be entitled <em>Conceptulizing Systems</em>, but was changed to <em>Thinking Object-Oriented</em> as this title better describes the content of the article.  I hope these are of benefit to you.<br />
<b>Real Power</b></p>

<p>One of the more difficult jumps of the several leaps and bounds from procedural to object-oriented programming is conceptualizing the system you are programming.  <em>Thinking</em> object-oriented is the real power of object-oriented programming, and even if we always program procedurally we may already be thinking object-oriented.  We need to be able to see a system, a problem, or a program in terms of objects and their relationships to one another.  When we do this any program will be much more simple and easy for us to grasp.  It will be easy to picture how it works in our minds.</p>

<p>There are three ways to think object-oriented.  One way it not better then another.  They are all just different and each of them is used as we start use objects appropriately.  I call these three ways the Top Down approach, the Bottom Up approach, and Real World Modeling.</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p><b>Top Down</b></p>

<p>The Top Down approach in object-oriented programming give us a way to see the system as a whole.  We break the entire system down into related parts.  The Model-View-Controller design pattern (we'll talk about design patterns in a later article) is an example of this.  It breaks the system into three parts: objects related to the business model, display objects, and objects to handle user input.</p>

<p>When we use the Top Down approach we need to think of how the system can be broken up into logical pieces.  We can slice up the entire system like I do a pie.  First I slice the pie in half, then in half again, making four pieces, then in half again.  I end up with nice evenly sized pieces, something I've never been able to do by slicing a piece at a time.  Similarly with a program or system (which might be a small part of a larger system) we break it up into larger pieces, then smaller ones, then even smaller ones, until we have pieces of a manageable size.</p>

<p>We can see the Top Down approach thinking with a short example.  Let's use the oh-so-common ecommerce store.  If we think of the system as a whole we know there will be data to keep, store functionality, and a good looking design that we want to change once in awhile.  We can break our data section down into session management and a database object.  We might break our store functionality into sections like the catalog, product reviews, the shopping cart, and the checkout.  We can have our display section broken down into a general template and a caching template that will cache pages for reuse (so the database doesn't have to work so hard).  We can then go over each of the functionality sections and further break them down into small pieces and objects.</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p><b>Bottom Up</b></p>

<p>The Bottom Up approach does not look at the system as a whole.  Instead, it concentrates on grouping related functionality together.  We see functions and variables as related and so put them together into an object.  Then we see objects which interact or are related and put them together into a group (called a package, usually put into the same folder etc.)  We can then group those object groups into larger and larger groups until we have the whole system accounted for.</p>

<p>Using this approach to think object-oriented we use two different steps.  The first step is grouping functionality into objects.  The second step is grouping objects into groups.  For step one, we figure out what goes together.  This can be easy if we already group our related procedural code into files.  We may have a file that contains all of our database functions in it.  Instead of having all the functions there sitting in the global scope and the variables they use (perhaps a connection variable, or a record-set variable), we can group it all into a database object, with properties such as the connection reference and functions such as query or closeConnection.</p>

<p>The second step is similar to the Top Down approach, just backwards.  Instead of breaking a system down into parts, we are building it up from the pieces we know we will have.  Grouping objects into larger and larger groups until we have the whole system makes it much easier to picture the internals of a system in our mind, and how things are actually working.  It also allows us and others to easily find pieces of functionality to extend or fix because they are organized into folders and files (packages and objects) in a logical manner.</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p><b>Model the Real World</b></p>

<p>Finally, Real World Modeling is one of the most powerful aspects of object-oriented programming.  This is making objects that you know in the real world into objects in your system.  Because we all live in the real world, it is easy for others to immediately understand what an object is and does if it is based off of something real world.</p>

<p>A customer, shopping cart, and product in an ecommerce store are immediately recognized and their interactions between each other are understood easily, because we can see the same interaction in our daily lives.  We know that there can be many products in our shopping cart.  We know that each customer may have a shopping cart to put their products in.  We know that customers have names and addresses, and that products have names and prices.  The programmatic shopping cart however may have related functionality that a real shopping cart may not have.  It may be able to tell us the total price of all the products in it, where a real cart can't do anything but roll around (something not needed in an ecommerce store). </p>

<p>The first thing you might do when developing a system is to discover all the real world objects in that system.  Whether it is employees, supplies, offices, text characters, documents, buttons, or trash cans, they all help us think of the system easier and model it better.  We already know many of the objects' interactions and who "owns" what (the customer owns the shopping cart and the cart owns the products).  These real world objects may even be the groupings of objects instead of the objects themselves.  Or they may be objects that help group others.  You might have a department object with its employees and manager.</p>

<p>Once you have the real world objects you can then group them.  The shopping cart, order, and checkout might go into the same section.  You may put products and categories into the catalog group.  Customers and store admin may be their own group.</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p><b>Object-Oriented Thinking</b></p>

<p>Object-oriented thinking has been around even before object-oriented programming.  People do it without knowing it might be called object-oriented.  It helps us conceptualize a system and better grasp it.  It helps us wrap our mind around a system without blowing a fuse.  It makes programming easier for us and easier for others coming to our code.  Object-oriented <em>programming</em> was created to make it easy to transfer our object-oriented <em>thinking</em> into code, although we can still program procedurally our object-oriented design.  This is the real power of object-oriented programming.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Our group project to build a framework finally has a name: Phlyte (pronounced like the word "flight"). It emphasizes the goal of our framework to be lightweight, not too complex, flexible, and easy to use.</p>

<p>I would invite anyone who is interested to subscribe to the new mailing list. Our in-person meetings that will occur probably 2-3 times per month are important, but not strictly required. Participation in the IRC channel at #uphpu or #phlyte on irc.freenode.net is highly encouraged. Subscribing to the mailing list is pretty much required.</p>

<p>A big part of Phlyte development will be about teaching each other how to be better developers, especially with PHP (and Python, for those helping with the Python version of Phlyte). Most of this will happen in the meetings and in team meetings, so it is important that everyone participate as much as possible.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who has participated so far, and I look forward to working with each of you more in the future!</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>This is the first of five articles on object oriented-programming from <a href="http://www.jacwright.com/">Jacob Wright</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>An Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming </li>
<li>Conceptualizing Systems</li>
<li>Planning an Application</li>
<li>Creating Objects</li>
<li>Making Objects Reusable</li>
</ul>

<p>An Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming will give a brief overview of why there is such a thing as object-oriented programming.  Conceptualizing Systems will help us to better picture a system in terms of objects and how the relate to each other.  Planning an Application will teach us the importance of planning and what we should do to plan.  Creating Objects explains how the objects in our application are born, and how they should be structured.  Making Objects Reusable covers some more advanced topics and allows us to reuse what weï¿½ve already created in good ways.  My hope is that these Monday morning articles will help others through the transition from procedural programming to object-oriented programming.</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p><b>Why Does Object-Oriented Programming Exist?</b></p>

<p>Back in the olden-days, way back when our dinosaurs were young and our parents roamed the earth, there was programming.  Yes, hard to believe it was invented by that time.  Back then, things were simpler.  Maybe people had to walk uphill both ways to school then, but programs were smaller, less complex.  Programming languages executed line by line.  They had ï¿½go-toï¿½ statements that let them go to another line for execution, and that was nice, but they didnï¿½t need a whole lot anyway.</p>

<p>Industrialization came along however.  Change was happening.  Programs became more complex.  It was hard to wrap the mind around a complex program and write it line by line.  Procedural programming was born.  Procedures or functions allowed a programmer to more easily conceptualize a system.  It allowed them to reuse code.  It was easier to program.</p>

<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) came about the same way.  When programs became larger and consequently more complex, it became very difficult to wrap oneï¿½s mind around them.  Object-oriented programming made programming a system easier.  It made life simpler again.</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p><b>Function, Function, Whoï¿½s Got the Function?</b></p>

<p>Many times procedural programming is referred to as ï¿½spaghetti code.ï¿½  Why is it called spaghetti code?  Because there are functions being called throughout the system and we canï¿½t know where they are coming from.  If we follow the flow of a procedural program, we can find ourselves looping in and out of functions and throughout scripts very much like a bowl of spaghetti.  There is not (inherently) much structure.  There is not much organization.  Object-oriented programming becomes more like building blocks we can build with instead of spaghetti.  It provides organization and we can know exactly where a given function is.  This also makes it easier to know where a bug is coming from.</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p><b>What Does Object-Oriented Programming Allow Us To Do?</b></p>

<p>Object-oriented programming allows us to reuse code.  It gives us a ï¿½packageï¿½ of related functions and their related variables that we can pass around or reuse in other systems.  These functions and variables that are all related are called methods and properties in an object.  Object-oriented programming can also enable the use of complicated code by everyone.  It not only ports the methods and properties together, but also allows us to use them without figuring out how they work internally.</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p><b>When Should We Use Object-Oriented Programming?</b></p>

<p>Object-oriented programming was conceived to allow us to create larger projects more simply.  Thus, it is very helpful in our larger projects that we do.  I can also be nice in smaller projects, especially once we get the hang of it.  Small projects are easily done in procedural programming though, and even once we learn how to program object-oriented we may still find ourselves using procedural at times.</p>

<p>Is it ok to mix objects with our procedural code?  Of course!  Many feel that if they are going to program object-oriented that they need to jump into the deep end and just start swimming.  That is just not true.  It would be much better to start using objects bit by bit, more and more, than to just not use them at all because we feel that it is too much for us.  Also, for small scripts it may just be easier to do them procedurally.</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p><b>So What Is Object-Oriented Programming?</b></p>

<p>Object-oriented programming is a way to think.  To conceptualize a system or a program.  It is not the classes, syntax, encapsulation, or other big words that we will learn about in following articles.  The true purpose of OOP is the empowering it gives us to see our programs in a new light, a higher view, a clearer picture.  It is hard to go back once youï¿½ve had a taste.</p>
