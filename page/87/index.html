                <p>&quot;Everyone is talking about &quot;Big Data&quot; but it can be daunting to know where to start. Learn how to get started with Big Data in minutes using Google Cloud&#039;s BigQuery for extremely fast results. We will discuss how BigQuery can tackle very big problems in a cost effective with data sets ranging from gigabytes to petabytes. We&#039;ll show how to easily load data into BigQuery, execute ad-hoc queries through the Web UI, and how to programmatically manage everything with PHP. Using the GitHub.com dataset, we&#039;ll show analyzing 2TB+ of data in 30 seconds or less. So stop wondering &quot;how can I collect all my data effectively&quot; and start getting the most out of your data today.&quot;

            <p><a href="http://www.dynamicwebpages.de/">DynamicWebPages.de</a> has their latest <a href="http://www.dynamicwebpages.de/60.php-statistiken.php">PHP Usage Statistics</a> posted today. Things just keep looking up for PHP usage - this month it gained a good chunk of domains from last month.PHP, in September, has been installed on approxamately 17,245,242 domains working its way onwards and upwards consistently. The number of actual IP addresses dropped a little this month, but not enough to cause much of a stir. Of course, numbers like this do show that most of the hosting environments out there with PHP are shared services, having serveral hundred domains on each.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/2004/09/26/apache-the-definitive-guide-3rd-ed-oreilly/">Apache: The Definitive Guide, 3rd edition</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>To cut to the chase, I heartily recommend this book. Any serious web server admin should have a copy of this book -- I've found it indispensable, and refer to it often. They're not exaggerating when they call it "The Definitive Guide"</p>

<p>Billed as, "Vital information for Apache Programmers and administrators," this book is definitely geared toward that audience -- programmers and admins. That said, the first chapter, "Getting Started," provides an excellent overview of basic web server concepts that most newbies could understand.</p>

<p><b>What I liked</b><br />I liked almost everything! I found the first half of the book (chapters 1-12) the most useful. These chapters covered just about everything you'd want to know about configuring and running apache. Beyond just the basics, the book covers in depth: virtual hosts, authentication, content description and modification, indexing, redirection, proxying, logging, security, and running a big web site. I came away with a much higher level of respect for Apache's capabilities -- I was really surprised how much I didn't know about Apache, and how much this book could tell me.</p>

<p>Additionally, there was a very interesting section on writing modules for Apache which, though a little beyond my expertise, gave me a better understanding of Apache's inner workings.</p>

<p><b>Disappointments</b><br />My biggest disappointment with the book was that it dealt so little with PHP, which only got 6 pages. I would have been less disappointed if they hadn't 50-plus pages to CGI/Perl and 17 pages to Java. Additionally, their XML section dealt almost entirely with Perl and Java, ignoring PHP. Granted, this isn't a PHP-specific book, but (considering I got the book via a PHP user group) I hoped for equal coverage.</p>

            <p>Well, the sun has really shined on use this past week. First, I would like to sincerelly thank each member that donated towards our new server fund! Your support is very much apprecaited by all. We have been very blessed.</p>

<p>I am very excited to announce to everyone that yesterday morning a group member's company responded to our plea and offered to sponsor us. They will be covering the rest of our needs for the new server. They will also be providing bandwidth and rack space.</p>

<p>Although the server is now taken care off, I would still like to encourage everyone to donate, as we still have some expenses and we would also like some funds to use for refreshments, activities, speakers for presentations and so forth.</p>

<p>Please take a minute to visit <a href="http://hostinginferno.com">Hosting Inferno</a> and thank them for their support. Please recommend them when consulting with clients.</p>

<p>So, thanks to all and we should be on the new server shortly. Enjoy your Thursday.</p>
