            <p>If you feel like your team could be more efficient in getting work delivered and out the door, take a look at Mob Programming. Woody Zuill coined the term Mob Programming as &quot;a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer.&quot; We&#039;ll talk about the principles and techniques used in Mob Programming and how to get started with your team. We’ll also do a short hands-on example to help you get a feel for if you’d like to try it with your team.

                <p>If you&#039;ve been involved in development very long, you&#039;ve probably experienced some projects that ended up being painful and less successful than you wanted. I&#039;ve definitely had my share. Through good advice, study, and a large helping of trial and error, I&#039;ve also managed to have some projects that exceeded my expectations. I&#039;ve learned some lessons the hard way, and in some cases, stumbled upon some techniques that I think work really well.

            <p>For our <a href="/events">April meeting</a>, <a href="http://josephscott.org/">Joseph Scott</a> will be presenting on the Anatomy of a PHP request. Continuing our series for beginners, we have Justin Carmony presenting on PHP Fundamentals.</p>

<p>Ever wondered what really happens when your PHP script runs? Justin cover the major milestones in the life and times of a PHP request (read, parse, compile, execute, output ) and where to look for road bumps along the way.  There are lots of tools available to make your PHP purr like a kitten, so I'll dive into op code caches (with APC),<br />
op code dumps (with VLD - Vulcan Logic Dumper), and  profiling (with Xdebug and webgrind).  It will be a great time digging a little deeper in to PHP!</p>

Joseph is a California native, living in Utah with his wife and children. He got hooked on email when it meant dialing into a BBS with a 2400 baud modem and ended up memorizing way too much of the AT command set. Access to the Internet changed all that and going to work for an ISP cemented that shift. It also exposed to him to the world of open source, starting with FreeBSD in 1996. From there he spent a number of years in IT doing a little bit of everything. Joseph joined Automattic in 2007, where he focuses on WordPress APIs (XML-RPC/AtomPub), realtime-ish updates (rssCloud/PuSH), WordPress.org themes and stats, and likes to dabble in front and back end<br />
performance hacks.

        <div>
            <p>For our <a href="/events">March meeting</a>, <a href="http://blog.calevans.com/ ">Cal Evans</a> will present on "5 Things I wish they had told me before I started programming in PHP." It will be excellent for all audiences! We're going to do things special for this one meeting: our presenter isn't going to be with us live. We are still going to be meeting at Bill Good Marketing as usual (and afterhours party as usual), but will be presenting to us via GotoWebinar.</p>

<p>5 Things I wish they had told me before I started programming in PHP is a raucous romp through PHP, covering not only mistakes that programmers make, but skills they need to make sure they master.</p>

<ol>
<li>Learn a framework. I don't care if you didn't write it, you're not (insert demigod programmer here) so quit thinking you've got it figured out. Frameworks exist for a reason and that reason it to give you the tools you need to do your job. If you are a carpenter, you don't go out and build your own circular saw before you start a project, you use one already built. We will review the 5 most popular PHP frameworks.</li>
<li>Learn that PHP is not (insert the language you last worked in). More importantly, we don't want it to be either. PHP is what it is, the best solution for web project. The faster you learn that, the faster you will get things done. PHP is unique and proud of it.</li>
<li>Learn where to get help. Help sites for PHP abound on the web. Anyone with a copy of Wordpress can start sharing the things that they've learned. Unfortunately, not all sites are created equally. If you are new to PHP, look to sites like phpdeveloper.org and DevZone as pointers to other good content. If you are an old hand, here are a few sites you may not know about that will help you get going.</li>
<li>Learn your stack. LAMP, WAMP, SAMP MAMP, or WIMP know the stack you are using inside and out. We'll cover the basics you have to know, from setting up a virtual domain, directory structure stratigies to url re-writing and logging. We will look at a few offerings including Zend Server.</li>
<li>Get Involved! Getting involved in the community is not somethng you do because you are bored on a friday night. it's something you do because you want to know more than the guy sitting in the cube next to you. You can either spend every night reading and memorizing the PHP manual, or you can get involved in the community and start talking with the people white the language. Theya re out there, they don't usually bite and they will help you as long as you don't expect them to do your job for you. The next time you boss asks you about the new Date() features in PHP 5.3, you can reply "Let me ask Derick real quick."</li>
</ol>

He has built a variety of projects ranging in size from simple web pages to multi-million dollar web applications. When not banging his head on his monitor, attempting a blood sacrifice to get a particular piece of code working, he enjoys building and managing development teams using his widely imitated but never patented management style of "management by wandering around". These days, when not working with PHP, Cal can be found working on a variety of projects, most of which require a higher security clearance than you have so they can't be listed here. Cal is currently based in Nashville TN where he is currently gainfully unemployed and seeking a job in IT so he doesn't have to go out and get a real job. Cal is happily married to wife 1.25, the lovely and talented Kathy. Together they have 2 wonderful kids who were both smart enough not to pursue a job in IT.
