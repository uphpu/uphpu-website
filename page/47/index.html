            <p>&quot;Due to the rise of mobile application restful back ends are in high demand. There are several PHP frameworks that promise to make this simpler.  In this presentation we&#039;ll use Lumen to implement and test a simple restful API with authentication. We&#039;ll also cover aspects of the Eloquent ORM.&quot;

            <p>&quot;Impostor syndrome can leave you feeling like you are a fraud and incompetent to be considered a professional in your chosen path. In reality, impostor syndrome is common and occurs when one struggles to internalize achievements and successes. Come feel a burden lifted when you realize that not only are you not an impostor, but you have actually succeeded in achieving something great. Hear about the experiences of others and how to overcome feeling like an impostor, and leave feeling confident in your accomplishments and skills.&quot;

We will focus on secure coding practices and discuss topics including SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, user authentication, and data validation. We will discuss how to bake security into an application and how to convince management that security issues must be addressed.&quot;

We’ll also explore some things to watch out for and how to figure out where traits could be introduced into your codebase.&quot;

        <div>
            <p>For our September <a href="/events/">meeting</a>, <a href="http://macnewbold.com">Mac Newbold</a> will be lecturing on SQL and PHP! Last year's meet was one of the highest attended.  </p>

<p>Mac Newbold is the owner of <a href="http://www.codegreene.com">Code Greene</a>, a highly successful web development company.  The company primarily uses PHP as its coding language.  Mac also is chief architect of Gradefix.com and a former contributor to Flyspray bug resolution.</p>

<p>Mac has Bachelor's (2001) and Master's (2004/2005) Degrees in Computer Science from the Univerisity of Utah. He spent over 4 years working on the Emulab Network Testbed system and web site, doing web and database programming and development, as well as research and development for their large cluster of computers and their web-driven automated network configuration tools, and has done consulting for other sites using their software. Since 2001 he has done computer consulting for a wide variety of clients, and currently focuses on improving design and implementation techniques for database-driven dynamic e-commerce web sites. </p>

<p>In addition to Mac's topic, he will also be speaking with members about potential job opportunities with his company. Two old computers will also be given away at this event; great for those interested in tinkering around and learning.</p>

<p>Last, we will do audio streaming again! Last time was <strong>very</strong> successful. We will issue out the information the day before so those of you who live far away can still participate in Mac's presentation.</p>
