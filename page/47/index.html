            <p>If you&#039;ve been involved in development very long, you&#039;ve probably experienced some projects that ended up being painful and less successful than you wanted. I&#039;ve definitely had my share. Through good advice, study, and a large helping of trial and error, I&#039;ve also managed to have some projects that exceeded my expectations. I&#039;ve learned some lessons the hard way, and in some cases, stumbled upon some techniques that I think work really well.

        <div>
            <p>For our September <a href="/events/">meeting</a>, <a href="http://macnewbold.com">Mac Newbold</a> will be lecturing on SQL and PHP! Last year's meet was one of the highest attended.  </p>

<p>Mac Newbold is the owner of <a href="http://www.codegreene.com">Code Greene</a>, a highly successful web development company.  The company primarily uses PHP as its coding language.  Mac also is chief architect of Gradefix.com and a former contributor to Flyspray bug resolution.</p>

<p>Mac has Bachelor's (2001) and Master's (2004/2005) Degrees in Computer Science from the Univerisity of Utah. He spent over 4 years working on the Emulab Network Testbed system and web site, doing web and database programming and development, as well as research and development for their large cluster of computers and their web-driven automated network configuration tools, and has done consulting for other sites using their software. Since 2001 he has done computer consulting for a wide variety of clients, and currently focuses on improving design and implementation techniques for database-driven dynamic e-commerce web sites. </p>

<p>In addition to Mac's topic, he will also be speaking with members about potential job opportunities with his company. Two old computers will also be given away at this event; great for those interested in tinkering around and learning.</p>

<p>Last, we will do audio streaming again! Last time was <strong>very</strong> successful. We will issue out the information the day before so those of you who live far away can still participate in Mac's presentation.</p>
