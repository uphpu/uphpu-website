            <p>&quot;Due to the rise of mobile application restful back ends are in high demand. There are several PHP frameworks that promise to make this simpler.  In this presentation we&#039;ll use Lumen to implement and test a simple restful API with authentication. We&#039;ll also cover aspects of the Eloquent ORM.&quot;

            <p>&quot;Impostor syndrome can leave you feeling like you are a fraud and incompetent to be considered a professional in your chosen path. In reality, impostor syndrome is common and occurs when one struggles to internalize achievements and successes. Come feel a burden lifted when you realize that not only are you not an impostor, but you have actually succeeded in achieving something great. Hear about the experiences of others and how to overcome feeling like an impostor, and leave feeling confident in your accomplishments and skills.&quot;

We will focus on secure coding practices and discuss topics including SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, user authentication, and data validation. We will discuss how to bake security into an application and how to convince management that security issues must be addressed.&quot;

We’ll also explore some things to watch out for and how to figure out where traits could be introduced into your codebase.&quot;

        <div>
            <p>Mac Newbold presented on strings in PHP, including: regular expressions (PCRE, POSIX), code execution/speed, working with html/databases/etc., and a review of various string processing functions.</p>

<p>Due to some technical difficulties, the audio recording of the meeting will not be available after all. The <a href="http://www.macnewbold.com/uphpu/">meeting notes</a> are available in Microsoft PowerPoint (PPT) format, plain text, and HTML.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/2005/01/07/verifying-email-addresses-in-php/">Verifying email addresses in PHP</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>A recent discussion in the <a href="http://uphpu.org/staticpages/index.php?page=20040521003849494">UPHPU IRC channel</a> (#uphpu on freenode.net) prompted me to submit something I use for validating email addresses. There's only so much you can do without actually sending a message, but this code uses three steps to check the address.</p>

<p>First, it checks it with a regular expression, to verify that it uses valid characters for the various parts of the address, and there  is an @ and at least one period, and they're in the right places. Second, it turns to DNS to verify that the domain exists. (DNS calls will probably need tweaking to work on Windows servers.) Best case is that it has an MX record for the domain. Second best is to verify that the domain simply exists and has an address. If it can pass the regular expression test and the DNS test, then it is most likely a valid address. The things we can't easily check are user-related, like user doesn't exist, has exceeded quota, etc. </p>

<p>In places where I've done comparisons with and without this checking in place, I've found very significant reductions (probably around 80%) in the number of bounced messages. While this can be used just before sending, it's often best to use it when accepting the email address from the user, to prevent bad addresses from getting into the system in the first place, and catch typographical errors. In cases where a long time has passed since the email was known to work, it may be helpful to check before sending the message as well.</p>

<pre><code>function ValidateEmail($e,$v=-1)
{
    global $verbose;

    /*  Return codes:
    0: appears to be a valid email
    1: didn't match pattern of a valid email
    2: looks valid by the pattern, but no DNS records found
   
        Try several things to make sure it is most likely valid:
    1. preg_match it to make sure it looks valid
    2a. If that passes, check for an MX entry for the domain
    2b. If no MX, check for any DNS entry for the domain
        */
    
    if ($v==-1)
    {
        $v=$verbose;
    }
    
    if (!preg_match("/^[a-z0-9.+-_]+@([a-z0-9-]+(.[a-z0-9-]+)+)$/i",
        $e, $grab))
    {
        return 1;
    }
    
    # $grab[0] is the whole address
    # $grab[1] is the domain
    
    $domain = $grab[1];
    $cmds = array("host -t MX $domain 2>&1 ","host $domain 2>&1 ");
    
    foreach ($cmds as $cmd)
    {
        $dns = trim(`$cmd`);
        
        if ($v)
        {
            print "n";
        }
        
        if (strpos($dns,"$domain mail is handled ")!==false || 
            strpos($dns,"$domain has address ")!==false ||
            strpos($dns,"$domain is an alias ")!==false)
        {
            # It is valid
            return 0;
        }
    }
    
    # If it didn't return yet, it's invalid, even
    # though it passed the preg.
    
    return 2;
