            <p>&quot;Due to the rise of mobile application restful back ends are in high demand. There are several PHP frameworks that promise to make this simpler.  In this presentation we&#039;ll use Lumen to implement and test a simple restful API with authentication. We&#039;ll also cover aspects of the Eloquent ORM.&quot;

            <p>&quot;Impostor syndrome can leave you feeling like you are a fraud and incompetent to be considered a professional in your chosen path. In reality, impostor syndrome is common and occurs when one struggles to internalize achievements and successes. Come feel a burden lifted when you realize that not only are you not an impostor, but you have actually succeeded in achieving something great. Hear about the experiences of others and how to overcome feeling like an impostor, and leave feeling confident in your accomplishments and skills.&quot;

We will focus on secure coding practices and discuss topics including SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, user authentication, and data validation. We will discuss how to bake security into an application and how to convince management that security issues must be addressed.&quot;

We’ll take a look at what traits are and how they help solve the problems they are intended to help solve. We’ll also explore some things to watch out for and how to figure out where traits could be introduced into your codebase.&quot;

        </header>
        <div>
            <p><a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/">Open Source Bridge</a> is a new conference for developers working with open source technologies. It will take place June 17-19 in Portland, OR, with five tracks connecting people across projects, languages and experience to explore how we do our work and why we participate in open source. The conference structure is designed to provide developers with an opportunity to learn from people they might not connect with at other events.</p>

<p>Open Source Bridge is run entirely by volunteers who believe in the need for an open source conference that focuses on the culture of being an open source citizen, regardless of where in the stack you choose to code. All proceeds from conference registration and sponsorship go directly to the costs of the conference.</p>

<p>Sessions and events will share in-depth knowledge about using, creating and contributing to open source as citizens of a greater community. You'll find relevant information whether you write web apps for the cloud, tinker with operating system internals, create hardware, run a startup, or blog about technology. They are still seeking <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/proposals/">proposals</a>&mdash;and just extended the deadline to April 10th&mdash;so submit yours before time runs out. Some examples of our proposals so far: Brian Aker on Drizzle, a reboot of MySQL designed "for the cloud"; Linux Kernel hacker Greg K-H about how Linux manages development; Ward Cunningham, inventor of the wiki, about what's next in collaboration; Amber Case, an anthropologist living in both the physical and virtual worlds, about Cyborg Citizenship.</p>

<p>In addition to regular conference sessions, they are holding an unconference day for free-form sessions, and host a 24-hour dedicated "hacker lounge" at the top of the Portland Hilton. In addition to hosting the hacker lounge, the Hilton has offered Open Source Bridge attendees steeply discounted room rates, starting at $139/night.</p>

<p>VisitÂ <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/">opensourcebridge.org</a> to learn more about the conference, see our session proposals, and register to attend.</p>

<p>UPHPU members can get $100 off registration with a registration code obtained by contacting <a href="http://uphpu.org/author/mindjuju/">Victor</a> or <a href="http://uphpu.org/author/wade/">Wade</a>. They have also given us one free conference pass to raffle off at our <a href="http://uphpu.org/events/">meeting</a> on 16 April.</p>
