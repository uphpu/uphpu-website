        </header>
        <div>
            <p><i>If you are at all interested in Linux, this is one book that you really must have in your library.  It is a book that you atleast need to check out.</i></p>

<p>I recently had the opportunity to review a new book in the Bruce Perens' Open Source Series entitled "Linux Quick Fix Notebook"by Peter Harrison. The book is definitely one to have in your library.  The first thing I did when i received the book was open it up to the table of contents and searched out some advanced topics that I have been looking to read. Topics like wireless networks, iptables, and LVMs to name a few.  I was impress to see those topics and more advanced topics like software raids, LDAP and Radius, and linux vpns.  Harrison wrote the book to follow a simple pattern of providing real answers to questions ranging from the most basic to advanced.</p>

<p>One of the first sections of the book that I read was "Expanding Disk Capacity".  In searching the table of contents this was one section that really caught my eye.    My reasoning for selecting this section is two fold: first, I wanted to see if the book could be used as a reference to various topics; and second, because I wanted to check out some of the advanced topics covered in the book.  Peter Harrison does a fanatastic job of focusing on the topic at hand and providing simple and intellegient instruction to your questions.  The flow of the book allows you to pick it up and start with a section and just move through it.</p>

<p>As I started reading the book, I noticed that the progression of the topics moved in an orderly fashion that a system administrator would follow. It allowed the basic administrator to start from the beginning and progress to an advanced level of configuration, security and optimization.  One item that I did not really like is the references to RedHat as the linux distro.  Yet, I can agree with Peter, that many users will start out with this distro or one similar.  I think that the topics are great, and my only regret is that there were not more topics to read about.</p>

<p>The book in its entirety is definitely a must have for any system administrator or software developer.  Mr. Harrison provides valuable information in sizable chunks for the reader to manage.  My only real critique would be to have a different layout in each topic. For example, in chapter 7 Peter discusses "The Linux Boot Process".  He does a great job of explaining and outlining the process. Still, I think that perhaps having sub-sections in the topics would allow readers to glean additional information. Like have a security, advanced, and optimization sub-sections to each topic.</p>

<p>All in all, Harrison does an exceptional job in bring many great topics into one book.  Harrison's style allows the reader to move forward or back without loosing momentum in the book.  The reader can get quick answers to their questions.</p>

            <p>&lt;</p>

<p>p><i>Ok, I know this isn't technically a PHP book.  However, Ray was gracious enough to get me this book for review, and I believe the book offers techniques and advice to just about any programmer, not just for C++.</i></p>

<p>Practical C++ Programming, like most O'Reilly books, is a top-notch technical book, with a focus on beginning programmers, but with enough readability to serve more experienced C++ coders.  Steve Oualline does a great job of mixing technical, aesthetic, and design advice, spattered with small, amusing anecdotes and miniature quizzes.  He uses examples effectively to reinforce standard programming concepts and gently nudge the reader along the sometimes painful path of C++.</p>

<p>The best aspect of the book isn't the technical knowledge passed along by Oualline;  it's the more abstract things he tackles that truly separate it from other C++ books, such as object orientated and procedural design practice, styling and naming conventions, and the tools of programming that many books miss: Makefiles and a brief overview of debugging utilities.  It's refreshing to read a book that takes such points into account, and I found myself nodding in agreement in these sections.</p>

<p>As far as technical material, Oualline keeps up-to-date by including sections on fairly new and complex topics such as namespaces, STL, and templates, without alienating the reader.  He uses code often to explain various points, keeping most examples small,  but building to larger snippets and build on previous chapters smoothly.   The 'C to C++' chapter in particular was excellent, and I think even C++ programmers could benefit from a quick overview of this section.</p>

<p>All in all, Practical C++ is an excellent book as a supplement to your generic C++ reference book, especially for those new to C++ programming or just coding in general.   However, I think many, more experienced, programmers could also benefit from his gems of wisdom on various topics that he sprinkles throughout the book.  I've come to expect the best from O'Reilly, and, again, I wasn't disappointed.  </p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/2005/04/24/the-zen-of-css-design-peach-pit/">The Zen of CSS Design</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p><img style="margin: 0 0 15px 15px" id="image292" src="http://uphpu.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/images.jpg" alt="images.jpg" align="right" />I just finished reading <a href="http://www.peachpit.com/title/0321303474">Zen of CSS Design, The: Visual Enlightenment for the Web</a> by <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/about/dave/">Dave Shea</a> and <a href="http://molly.com/about.php">Molly E. Holzschlag</a>. For those that don't recognize the name,  Dave Shea is the "creator and cultivator of the highly influential <a href="http://csszengarden.com">CSS Zen Garden</a>." The book is well-written, interesting, and covers the subject well.</p>

<p>The way in which the book covers web design is both different and interesting. Instead of simply mechanically moving through lessons, the auther covers web design standards, principles, and techniqueï¿½ by using the conceptualization, birth, and life of the website CSS Zen Garden as a perpectual example. The result provides for interesting reading and for an excellent real-world example experience.</p>

<p>Another thing that makes this book different from many web development books is that it spends more time covering design theory than technical application. This to me is exciting, because even though it was very elementary to me personally, we always need to be reminded about the fundamental principles of design. This book will be of most value however to those just beginning their education in web design or those with a more technical background seeking to improveï¿½or at least enhance their understanding or appreachiation ofï¿½good design.</p>

<p>What I found most interesting about the book was the history of Shea and his adventure with CSS Zen Garden. He descripes this interests with web design, web standards, and making a statement. It was interesting to follow the detailed process of organizing his efforts, putting the project together, and partaking of an insiders view of something that has been such a high profile event.</p>

<p>All-in-all, the book is a good read. It was quick, but effective. I did find the last half of the book to be a little repetative, but that might have been because the principles were already understood. Advanced CSS masters will find little value in the book technically, but the history of the web described in the biginning chapters and the story of the Zen Garden makes it still a worthwhile read. Novices and others looking to increase their knowledge of CSS and general web layout however, will be findï¿½ a collection of lessons and tutorials pulled from real page examples hosted online in the garden archives.</p>

<p>I was a little disappointed, but that is only because I was hoping to learn something new and not because the book was lacking. It was simply because the book is for a more entry-level audienceï¿½and for that it achieves it's purpose well.</p>
