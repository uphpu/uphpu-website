            <p>&quot;Due to the rise of mobile application restful back ends are in high demand. There are several PHP frameworks that promise to make this simpler.  In this presentation we&#039;ll use Lumen to implement and test a simple restful API with authentication. We&#039;ll also cover aspects of the Eloquent ORM.&quot;

            <p>&quot;Impostor syndrome can leave you feeling like you are a fraud and incompetent to be considered a professional in your chosen path. In reality, impostor syndrome is common and occurs when one struggles to internalize achievements and successes. Come feel a burden lifted when you realize that not only are you not an impostor, but you have actually succeeded in achieving something great. Hear about the experiences of others and how to overcome feeling like an impostor, and leave feeling confident in your accomplishments and skills.&quot;

We will focus on secure coding practices and discuss topics including SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, user authentication, and data validation. We will discuss how to bake security into an application and how to convince management that security issues must be addressed.&quot;

                <p>&quot;Traits were added to PHP in version 5.4 as another tool to use to create clean code. We’ll take a look at what traits are and how they help solve the problems they are intended to help solve. We’ll also explore some things to watch out for and how to figure out where traits could be introduced into your codebase.&quot;

        </header>
        <div>
            <p><em><b>Attention: If you're interested in the training classes and/or the group project, read this and respond appropriately!</b></em></p>

<p>The plan is moving forward, and we're working out the logistical details of getting the course off the ground.There are a couple of important discussion threads on the mailing list, and a poll to plan days of the week, measure interest and estimate attendance. We are in urgent need of some feedback from people, whether they're interested in training, the group project, or both.</p>

<p><b><em>If you're interested in participating in the training courses:</em></b></p>

<p><b>1. We need to you to take the poll, so we can decide on a day.</b> For now, don't worry about cost, location, or anything like that, and just assume we'll be able to work things out with you.</p>

<p><b>2. "Pre-register" with Wade or myself, the sooner the better.</b> We need to get together a list of interested people so we can email the smaller group and expect to get answers back in a timely fashion. Without being able to contact everyone, it will be really hard to make this work.</p>

<p><b><em>If you're not interested in training, but would like to participate in the group project:</em></b></p>

<p><b>1. Some of the group project meetings will coincide with training meetings.</b> For example, the first half of a training meeting may be discussion and planning for the group project, while the second half would be training related to the plans that were made.</p>

<p><b>2. Take the poll, and select your day(s) of choice.</b> The team working on the project has to have time to get together, and we need to know when you can make it.</p>

<p><b>3. Tell Wade or myself that you're interested in the project but not training classes.</b> If you'd like to also specify what level or kind of involvement you'd like to have, that might help too. We'll probably set up a developer mailing list for the project along with CVS or subversion accounts and access to a MySQL database for all the team members.</p>

<p>We really want to know what people want to do, and where UPHPU should be focusing to provide the most benefits to its members and our community. Without some participation from other people, it will end up being based on the ideas of just a few of us, and probably won't be as good.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone for your participation in UPHPU!</p>

        <div>
            <p>We are condering some new ideas and events to increase group participation and skills. Please take a moment to vote.  We are very interested in feedback from the group and nonmembers alike.</p>

<p>First, we are interested in knowing what individuals are looking for in our montly presentations? Are you satisfied or are could you use more? Why do you come? Why don't you come? What would bring you out more often? Would you like to meet more than once a month?</p>

<p>Second, we are considered sponsoring monthly or even semi-monthly training courses. Please let us know if this is something that you could benefit from and would be interested in. How much would you be willing to pay? The cost of these would be minimal and would for the most part be only to cover production costs.</p>

<p>Thanks for everyone's interest and participation!</p>
