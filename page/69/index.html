            <p>If you feel like your team could be more efficient in getting work delivered and out the door, take a look at Mob Programming. Woody Zuill coined the term Mob Programming as &quot;a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer.&quot; We&#039;ll talk about the principles and techniques used in Mob Programming and how to get started with your team. We’ll also do a short hands-on example to help you get a feel for if you’d like to try it with your team.

                <p>If you&#039;ve been involved in development very long, you&#039;ve probably experienced some projects that ended up being painful and less successful than you wanted. I&#039;ve definitely had my share. Through good advice, study, and a large helping of trial and error, I&#039;ve also managed to have some projects that exceeded my expectations. I&#039;ve learned some lessons the hard way, and in some cases, stumbled upon some techniques that I think work really well.

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>A gentleman popped into our <a href="/staticpages/index.php?page=20040521003849494#IRC">IRC channel</a> this evening asking for some help writing some HTML. He was having a hard time aligning some badges at the bottom of a column. Being all hopped up on birthday cake icing, I accepted the opportunity to write some code for the fun of it and recoded his page. I present to you now a case study in composing valid XHTL and good layout. In the process of exemplifying a possible solution to this man's problem, I would like to illustrate how simple, lean, and user-friendly proper, valid code can (and definately should) be.</p>

<p><a href="/presentations/2005-11-27_valid_xhtml_case_study/original/">View original code.</a> | <a href="/presentations/2005-11-27_valid_xhtml_case_study/redesign/">View my code.</a></p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p>Now, if you attempt to validate the authors code, you will notice that it actually almost validates. So, what is the problem? Why didn't I simply align his badges at the bottom of his column and move on? I will not take the time to critique his code completely here, but will offer the following general observations instead:</p>

<ol>
<li>tables should not be used for layout</li>
<li>code should be lowercase</li>
<li>indentation and tag pedigree should be visually logical and consistant</li>
<li>it is 2005, there is no reason that all code shouldn't be at least XHTML transitional</li>
<li>style declarations should be contained within an external style sheet</li>
<li>good code should not just be legible; it should be beautiful</li>
</ol>

            <p>For our November meeting, <a href="/users.php?mode=profile&uid=14">Mac Newbold</a> presented on arrays. A fun-filled evening of exciting adventures was had with everyone's favorite PHP data type. We covered both lists and associative arrays, the differences between them, and their respective operators and functions. We demonstrated how to use them in various loop constructs, and a million and one ways to sort your arrays. We showed everyone how to use arrays in some of the other standard PHP functions, like the string functions. And finally, we covered how to use arrays to make advanced data structures, like multi-dimentional arrays, lists of lists, and "structs" or mock objects.</p>
