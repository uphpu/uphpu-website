            <p>If you feel like your team could be more efficient in getting work delivered and out the door, take a look at Mob Programming. Woody Zuill coined the term Mob Programming as &quot;a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer.&quot; We&#039;ll talk about the principles and techniques used in Mob Programming and how to get started with your team. We’ll also do a short hands-on example to help you get a feel for if you’d like to try it with your team.

                <p>If you&#039;ve been involved in development very long, you&#039;ve probably experienced some projects that ended up being painful and less successful than you wanted. I&#039;ve definitely had my share. Through good advice, study, and a large helping of trial and error, I&#039;ve also managed to have some projects that exceeded my expectations. I&#039;ve learned some lessons the hard way, and in some cases, stumbled upon some techniques that I think work really well.

            <p>The Utah PHP Users Group is run and supported entirely by volunteers. This incredible resource and service is ours because of the generosity of every member's time and talents. These services include support from local businesses and corporations, locations for our monthly meetings, donations from publishers, and our web resources (bandwidth and hosting).</p>

<p>As we have just recently passed our one year anniversary, it is a good time for reflection on what we have accomplished and how we have grown. We are now 150 members strong. I would take the opportunity to thank everyone that has given to the group so selflessly and generously. We are fast becoming the definitive resource in Utah for both developers and employers, in resource of knowledge and skill, camaraderie, and support of standards-based and developing technologies. I hope that we may continue to grow and continue to become increase our recognition and respect for this.</p>

<p>I also approach you with some requests. The success of our group is directly proportional to what each of us put into it. We are continually seeking for additional assistance from local companies and organizations for support. We need more volunteers to present and host activities. We would like to establish additional relationships with sponsors and technology firms.</p>

<p>We are also needing to upgrade our server. The wind has carried rumors of us upgrading our mailing list for some time now and it is time to take action on this need. Our website is currently hosted on a virtual account with the mail and mailing list(s) on a separate server. I would like to move everything to a collocated server where we may have a home that is entirely ours. There, we will also be able to finally make the upgrade to mailman, that we have all dreamed of for so long. I will continue to supply the hosting and bandwidth, but will need some assistance for the purchase of the hardware.</p>

<p>If you are interested in assisting an anyway, wether it be time, talents, or resources, you may do so by contacting <a href="http://www.uphpu.org/users.php?mode=profile&uid=43">Dave</a>, our volunteer in charge of activities.</p>

<p>You may donate financially through <a href="http://www.uphpu.org/staticpages/index.php?page=20040520232950120">PayPal</a> or in person at any of our activities. If only fifty of us donate five dollars each, we would have $250 to put towards a new server.</p>

<p>Thanks for your support! We are glad you are part of the group. Please let us know what things your find useful and feel free to submit any suggestions or ideas.</p>

This article aims to clearly answer seven of the most common questions asked by PHP users about MySQL's licensing. For each question, this article attempts to provide a simple and direct answer that focuses on the intent of the question, rather than its literal meaning. Additionally, for each question and answer, there is also a more detailed and technical supporting discussion.</p>
