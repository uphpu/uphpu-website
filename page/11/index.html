            <p>If you feel like your team could be more efficient in getting work delivered and out the door, take a look at Mob Programming. Woody Zuill coined the term Mob Programming as &quot;a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer.&quot; We&#039;ll talk about the principles and techniques used in Mob Programming and how to get started with your team. We’ll also do a short hands-on example to help you get a feel for if you’d like to try it with your team.

                <p>If you&#039;ve been involved in development very long, you&#039;ve probably experienced some projects that ended up being painful and less successful than you wanted. I&#039;ve definitely had my share. Through good advice, study, and a large helping of trial and error, I&#039;ve also managed to have some projects that exceeded my expectations. I&#039;ve learned some lessons the hard way, and in some cases, stumbled upon some techniques that I think work really well.

            <p>I'm pleased to announce this month's meeting:</p>

<p>Thursday, January 19th, at 7pm at C7 Bluffdale Datacenter</p>

<p>Joanna Carmony: Best Accounting Practices for the Web Development Industry</p>

<p>Come and learn from an accountant with years of experience what you should be doing better with your books. There should be something for everyone, whether you own a web development business, own a business that does some web development, are self-employed, or just do some freelance on the side.</p>

<p>As time allows, we'll have a round-table discussion to take advantage of the collective expertise in the group on the subject, and discuss any questions you may have about the business side of web development.</p>

<p>As usual, we'll be having our after-party at the Draper Applebees, starting around 9pm. Feel free to join us!</p>

        <div>
            <p>For our December <a href="/events">meeting</a>, Justin Carmony will present on "Blazing Data with Redis." There are several solutions about in the "NoSQL" realm, and I'll be honest, Redis is one of my favorites. Redis is an open source, advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets.</p>

<p>What is great about Redis is just how fast it is. In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Redis works with an in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.</p>

<p>So come down and learn the basics of Redis, whether using it as an advanced cache alternative to Memcached, a queueing system, a data store, or anything where you would benefit from high performance reads and writes.</p>
