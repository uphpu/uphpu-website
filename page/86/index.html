        </header>
        <div>
            <p>As an XML developer I spend most of my time working with XML and technologies related to XML. I began reading "Learning XML" with the mindset of finding new and interesting topics. Erik Ray provided some great reading on such topics as Schema, RELAX NG, and Schematron.</p>

<p>I found the first few chapters (1-4) to be a great review, covering basics and key concepts of XML. Mr. Ray does a fantastic job at explaining and providing examples that illustrate basic and complex syntax of XML. He also lets the reader know if there are additional items to discuss later in future chapters. This allowed me to skip forward and review those sections.</p>

<p>Even though I have many years of experience with XML, I never found "Learning XML" dull or boring in the least regard. "Learning XML" continued to provide information that allowed me to read on with interest.</p>

<p>The author also takes the reader into other XML technologies like XPath, XSLT, and XSL-FO. There are many books out there that deal with each of these technologies individually, yet the author provides a strong introduction and foundation to these technologies.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite sections deal with DOM, SAX, pull parsing, DTDs, and Unicode of XML documents.</p>

<p>Even though this book provides tons of satisfying examples, I was really looking forward to at least one chapter on advanced topics or theory. However to my dismay there was not one. Overall, Erik Ray does a great job in presenting, explaining and demonstrating XML and XML technologies to his readers. I encourage anyone that is looking for a great book on XML to check out "Learning XML".</p>

            <p>With the cost of Web access and Web accounts going south and issues with the quality of service constantly resurfacing, VARs are touting PHP for dynamic Web pages. In a new <a href="http://www.crn.com/sections/features/features.jhtml?articleId=49901891">article</a> that focuses on Web hosting, CRN takes a look at why solution providers and vendors alike are so excited about PHP. Matt Villano, the author, goes onto say, "With more than 15 million Web sites running PHP, the language is the hottest thing to hit hosting since AOL. Customers are clamoring for it, and solution providers are selling PHP-based services in droves. As a result, vendors like Alabanza and Zend Technologies are launching new channel efforts designed to help partners make PHP a top se</p>
