            <p>Object Relational Mapping has proven superior to SQL query based applications.  Advantages include building your database from the ORM metadata and the ability to traverse the database using objects.  An overview of why ORM is better then specific aspects of ORM such as the Query Builder will give the attendee a realistic understanding of the technology.

                <p>If you feel like your team could be more efficient in getting work delivered and out the door, take a look at Mob Programming. Woody Zuill coined the term Mob Programming as &quot;a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer.&quot; We&#039;ll talk about the principles and techniques used in Mob Programming and how to get started with your team. We’ll also do a short hands-on example to help you get a feel for if you’d like to try it with your team.

Billed as a "thinly disguised recruiting effort to find the best local engineers," the competition is open to all Utah residents.</p>

<p>The previous deathmatch saw over 100 participants and was a success both for the 8 finalists who received prize money, and for BDS who hired 4 new engineers in the process.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I am excited to announce the launch of the <a href="http://ugaf.org">Utah Graphic Artists Forum</a>. For years I have longed for a place where I could interactive with and meet new local artists. Having participated in many technical groups, I have grown to rely on and take for granted both the camaraderie and invaluable resource of information that such communities provide. Often frustrated by the lack of an official forum for art related questions however, I vowed to someday create the resource I longed for.</p>

<p>Officially launching tomorrow, I present the Utah Graphic Artists Forum, a gathering place for local graphic artists. My purpose is to promote and support the development and expression of graphic arts and to facilitating and ecouraging conversations and interaction between graphic artists in Utah, in an environment free of dues or obligations. I hope to provide something of value to members involved in all forms of the graphic arts, including illustrators, photographers, graphic designers, typographers, user interface designers, and web developers.</p>

<p>Both working professionals and students are welcome and encouraged to participate, discussing current events and trends, historical topics, theory, techniques, technology, business, and/or employment.</p>

<p>Features include a forum, mailing lists, an IRC channel for chat, job announcements, RSS feeds, syndicated calendar events, and plans to meet periodically for socials and workshops. Membership is free and open to anyone interested.</p>

<p>I encourage you to visit the site, register an account, and participate in the forum.</p>
