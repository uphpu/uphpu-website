            <p>&quot;Due to the rise of mobile application restful back ends are in high demand. There are several PHP frameworks that promise to make this simpler.  In this presentation we&#039;ll use Lumen to implement and test a simple restful API with authentication. We&#039;ll also cover aspects of the Eloquent ORM.&quot;

            <p>&quot;Impostor syndrome can leave you feeling like you are a fraud and incompetent to be considered a professional in your chosen path. In reality, impostor syndrome is common and occurs when one struggles to internalize achievements and successes. Come feel a burden lifted when you realize that not only are you not an impostor, but you have actually succeeded in achieving something great. Hear about the experiences of others and how to overcome feeling like an impostor, and leave feeling confident in your accomplishments and skills.&quot;

We will focus on secure coding practices and discuss topics including SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, user authentication, and data validation. We will discuss how to bake security into an application and how to convince management that security issues must be addressed.&quot;

                <p>&quot;Traits were added to PHP in version 5.4 as another tool to use to create clean code. We’ll take a look at what traits are and how they help solve the problems they are intended to help solve. We’ll also explore some things to watch out for and how to figure out where traits could be introduced into your codebase.&quot;

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>For our August <a href="/events/">meeting</a>, <a href="http://blog.utahcon.com/about-2">Utahcon</a> will present a quickstart to the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a>. Every PHP developer should have a firm grasp on a framework as they make light work of heavy projects. The Zend Framework is a great example of what a framework should be; both light and flexible while offering a good structure and strict MVC environment. This presentation will be a walk through and Q&A on the Zend Framework Quickstart, as well as a quick lesson on using Zend_Captcha.</p>

<blockquote><p>Utahcon is a world renowned PHP developer having worked for companies like Overstock.com, SOS Staffing, GrabTakeout.com, Code Greene and more! Utahcon has been developing in PHP for over 10 years, and still considers himself to be a noob. Join us for a lot of fun and entertainment (possibly at Utahcon's expense).</p></blockquote>

<p>Come early for good seatings. We expect the afterparty to be at Applebees at the Gateway again, unless there's a majority in favor of switching it up.</p>

            <p>As you've probably recently heard, our great and fearless leader Victor 'mindjuju' Villa has made some changes, and our previous venue will no longer be available, on top of which he has passed his UPHPU baton to me.</p>

<p>While it is definitely not a requirement that the meetings be held at the place of employment of the current president, that tradition will continue for the foreseeable future, as he new <a href="/events">meeting location</a> is my place of employment. We're the one with the big green stripe on the front window and door. Note that you can get to us via southbound State Street at 350 S onto Exchange Place, or via westbound 400 South at about 30 E, onto Cactus Street. Many of you may be familiar with XMission, and we're right across the back alley from them. Also important to note is that parking on the street at meters is free after 6pm, and parking in the garage across the street will cost $5 for the evening, and we will be unable to validate. We will continue to meet at seven o'clock on the evening of the third Thursday of each month.</p>

<p>There is an Applebee's at the Gateway, a short free Trax ride away from our meeting location, so I anticipate we'll head over there en masse after the presentation for the after-party. They also validate an hour of parking I think if anyone wanted to drive over there rather than come back to get a car.</p>

<p>If we find that the downtown location is for whatever reason undesirable, we can switch things up. Since I live in Draper, I would be happy to do the after party at the Draper Applebee's if people would prefer, but I suspect our friends from the North might not like driving down there just for a different Applebee's, but I could be wrong. </p>
