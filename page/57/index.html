                <p>&quot;Impostor syndrome can leave you feeling like you are a fraud and incompetent to be considered a professional in your chosen path. In reality, impostor syndrome is common and occurs when one struggles to internalize achievements and successes. Come feel a burden lifted when you realize that not only are you not an impostor, but you have actually succeeded in achieving something great. Hear about the experiences of others and how to overcome feeling like an impostor, and leave feeling confident in your accomplishments and skills.&quot;

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>We will be holding another Geek Lunch this friday. If there continues to be interest, we'll probably try to do this once a month or so. The last one was at the Dragon Diner (Chinese food) on 3300 South and 1300 East, and we'd like to keep rotating locations so that the driving distances are reasonable for people as often as possible. So far most of the interest has been in SL County, though there's at least Timothy in Ogden who'd love it if we did something up that way. Of course, nothing stops us from having them in different locations (i.e. Utah Valley) too, even on the same day as a SL get together. We're open to suggestions for future venues too.</p>

<p>Friday, 29 September at 12:30<br />
India House<br />
8660 South State Street, Sandy<br />
Lunch Buffet is about $8 before tax and tip</p>
