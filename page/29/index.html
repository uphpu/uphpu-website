            <p>If you&#039;ve been involved in development very long, you&#039;ve probably experienced some projects that ended up being painful and less successful than you wanted. I&#039;ve definitely had my share. Through good advice, study, and a large helping of trial and error, I&#039;ve also managed to have some projects that exceeded my expectations. I&#039;ve learned some lessons the hard way, and in some cases, stumbled upon some techniques that I think work really well.

        <div>
            <p>I have created a Google Group for us so that you may "wave" to everyone in the group via Google Wave. Unfortunately, we didn't get a pretty URL or email address because they were already used and Google has a lame rule that they can only be used once, even if the previous instance has been deleted (which was by me, which makes it even more lame).</p>

<p>Visit the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/utahphp">Google Group home page</a> for more information. <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/utahphp/subscribe">Join the group</a> and then add the address "utahphp@googlegroups.com" to your Google Contacts list. You can then add the group address to new waves and everyone will have access to it.</p>

<p>Note that Wave will bark that that user does not have a valid Wave account when you try to add it. Ignore that and simply strike the return key and the address will be added to your contact list.</p>

            <p>For our <a href="/events/">September meeting</a>, our founder, <a href="/author/wade/">Wade Shearer</a> will present on front-end web development, specifically focusing on markup, styles, and foundation architectural structures. The presentation will be a live coding demonstration developing a global site template using HTML and Cascading Style Sheets. He will take an audience-submitted design and produce production-ready code and site assets as far as time and questions will allow. Attendees interested in submitting a design should come to the meeting prepared with a digital copy of artwork for a website or web application (layered Photoshop file preferably). The design used will be selected randomly from those in attendance. A basic understanding of web technology and coding is recommended.</p>
