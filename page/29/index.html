We will focus on secure coding practices and discuss topics including SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, user authentication, and data validation. We will discuss how to bake security into an application and how to convince management that security issues must be addressed.&quot;

                <p>&quot;With technology more important to the bottom line than ever, you&#039;d think there&#039;d be career opportunities up the wazoo. But the suits don&#039;t really understand what you do for a living. And they hold the keys to the executive washroom. So, while you&#039;re saving the company&#039;s bacon on a daily basis, these guys are upstairs in the corner offices with the nice view. It doesn&#039;t have to be that way. And it won&#039;t be, if you assemble a solid strategy for advancing your career.&quot;

                <p>&quot;Money is one of the primary reasons for freelancing, but most of us are doing it wrong. As a result, we lose out on some of the things that money can buy. Some of these are freedom, security, and peace of mind. So let’s fix that. In this seminar, we’ll cover some key lessons that will change the way you look at side projects and freelance gigs.&quot;

        <div>
            <p>I have created a Google Group for us so that you may "wave" to everyone in the group via Google Wave. Unfortunately, we didn't get a pretty URL or email address because they were already used and Google has a lame rule that they can only be used once, even if the previous instance has been deleted (which was by me, which makes it even more lame).</p>

<p>Visit the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/utahphp">Google Group home page</a> for more information. <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/utahphp/subscribe">Join the group</a> and then add the address "utahphp@googlegroups.com" to your Google Contacts list. You can then add the group address to new waves and everyone will have access to it.</p>

<p>Note that Wave will bark that that user does not have a valid Wave account when you try to add it. Ignore that and simply strike the return key and the address will be added to your contact list.</p>

            <p>For our <a href="/events/">September meeting</a>, our founder, <a href="/author/wade/">Wade Shearer</a> will present on front-end web development, specifically focusing on markup, styles, and foundation architectural structures. The presentation will be a live coding demonstration developing a global site template using HTML and Cascading Style Sheets. He will take an audience-submitted design and produce production-ready code and site assets as far as time and questions will allow. Attendees interested in submitting a design should come to the meeting prepared with a digital copy of artwork for a website or web application (layered Photoshop file preferably). The design used will be selected randomly from those in attendance. A basic understanding of web technology and coding is recommended.</p>
