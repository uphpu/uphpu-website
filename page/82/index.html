            <p>With PHP 5.6 there are some great new features. We&#039;ll go over some of these features and how to use them. This includes variadic functions, constant scalar expressions, exponentiation, splat operator, use const/function, php input, phpdbg, and more. We will also cover deprecated features in PHP 5.6. Want to get involved with upcoming release? I&#039;ll show you how you can &#039;make_test&#039; to start helping out.

            <p>It has been several years that I have been looing for an adequate solution to the task of giving a user non-shell, chrooted, secure server access. I finally found that in an small application called <a href="http://www.sublimation.org/scponly/">scponly</a>. It was simple to <a>install</a>, easy to configure and use, and got the job done beautifully. A script is even provided for setting up accounts, assisting you in configuring all the options. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a similar solution.</p>

        <div>
            <p>The generosity and support that pours out to our group never ceases to amaze me. Once again, in our hour of need, some of the most wonderful and unexpected individuals have stepped up and taken care of us, often even before we realized we needed it.</p>

<p>We would like to take a moment to report on the progress of our project and to publicly thank everyone that has so graciously contributed. To-date, we have received almost a hundred dollars in donations from our members. I am thrilled to announce that with this a server has been purchased. Installation and configuration is nearly complete and it will be online very shortly. We have been able to acquire hardware that will serve us well for some time. Several offers for donated or subsidized rack space and bandwidth have also been given. The invitation from UVNet has been selected and we will begin calling their data center in Orem our new home within a few days. We have also received much assistance in planning, preparation, and execution of the overall project from local businesses, organization, members, and friends of the group.</p>

<p>Specifically, we would like to thank the following for their support or donations:</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p><i>Adam Olsen, Beau Scott, Brady Mitchell, <a href="http://www.serverserv.com/">Computer Admin, LLC</a>, Fluidtiger.com, Gary Thornock, Jared Smith, Jonathan Duncan, John Anderson, Ken Williams, Lonnie Olson, Mac Newbold, Ray Hunter, <a href="twinpeakstech.com">Twin Peaks Technology, LLC</a>, <a href="http://www.uvnet.net/">UVNET, Inc.</a>, <a href="http://webpipe.net/">Webpipe.net, Inc.</a>, <a href="http://xmission.com/">XMission</a>.</i></p>

<p>We would also like to announce that UVNet has just been selected as an additional official mirror for php.net! We are thrilled about this new formed friendship, excited about their interest in our group and PHP, and look forward to working with them in the future. We encourage everyone to recommend them to clients and to look to them for any collocation or ISP needs that you may have.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we thank everyone for the outpouring of support and for the wonderful community that we have. Please take a moment to send in both your donation (if you have not yet and would still like to do so) and your comments on ideas you have for the group or ways in which we can better serve you.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>A monthly breakfast, started by Matt Asay, the Director of the Linux Business Office at  Novell/SuSE, is being held for anyone that wants to meet other Utah entrepreneurs, or potential investors. These breakfasts draw a wide range of entrepreneurs, from many disciplines, along with potential angle and VC investors. For someone thinking of doing their first, or next, start-up it is a place to meet others doing the same thing- from experienced and successful entrepreneurs to the graphic designers, accountants and sales people that can assist. Matt created this event to get more entrepreneurs in Utah networking with each other.<br />
Their information follows:</p>

<p>Join us on Friday, February 4 at 8:00 a.m., for light refreshments and networking. Bring yourself, bring a friend, bring your boss, bring five dollars   we'll provide the rest, no reservation required.</p>

<p>There are a few changes to the 2005 breakfast series:  this year, we're moving up from the 2nd floor of the Center to the 3rd floor.  Also, we're offering participants a posting board.  Bring materials to post including employment opportunities, service provider information, capital resources needed, etc. etc.  Creativity is encouraged!</p>

<p>If you are interested in giving a 2-minute "elevator pitch" to promote your business, please respond to this e-mail with the phrase "Elevator Pitch" in the subject line and include your telephone number so that we may contact you. </p>

<p>Note to genus breakfast newbies:<br />
The genus venture breakfasts are intended to bring together the people that make up a successful startup, from entrepreneur to VC to recruiter to accountant to government official, and anyone else I may be leaving out.  You were likely referred by someone already in attendance, or you attended another event sponsored by the hosts at Miller Business Innovation Center.  Unlike other events staged by UITA, Mountain West Venture Group, T2M, etc. (all of which are great, and deserve your attention), we're focusing on making these gatherings informal, speaker-less, and inclusive.  The purpose is to create a regular forum for people in Utah's venture community to meet, swap ideas, and hopefully make a billion dollars.  No Ponzi schemes.  No Amway.  Just a breeding ground for good ideas, good connections, and good business.</p>
