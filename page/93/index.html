        </header>
        <div>
            <p>&lt;</p>

<p>p>A new <a href="http://www.devshed.com/c/a/MySQL/Backing-up-and-restoring-your-MySQL-Database/">article</a> by <a href="http://www.devshed.com">DevShed</a> discusses backing up,  transferring, and restoring databases and discusses options and utilities to make this task simpler.<i></p>

<p>Do you need to change your web host or switch your database server? This is probably the only time when you really think of backing up your MySQL data. If you've got a website with a database or your custom database running for your applications, it is imperative that you make regular backups of the database. In this article, I will outline two easy ways of backing up and restoring databases in MySQL.</p>

<p>The easiest way to backup your database would be to telnet to the your database server machine and use the mysqldump command to dump your whole database to a backup file. If you do not have telnet or shell access to your server, don't worry about it; I shall outline a method of doing so using the PHPMyAdmin web interface, which you can setup on any web server which executes PHP scripts.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p><a href="http://www.devshed.com">Dev Shed</a> has an article about <a href="http://www.devshed.com/c/a/PHP/PHP-Security-Mistakes/">common PHP security mistakes</a>, and how to avoid them. It's fairly basic stuff -- but a good review for even the most expert programmers. If you're not following their advice, you should be.</p>

<p>On a completely unrelated note, I noticed that Dev Shed appears to be using <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a> or something with very similar behaviour. I checked it out at <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/">Netcraft</a>, on the off chance that Dev Shed had that information exposed. Interestingly, Netcraft <a href="http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/graph?site=www.devshed.com">replied</a> that it has been asked not to report  on Dev Shed -- which is a request I didn't even know could be made. You learn something every day . . .</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/2004/06/10/inactive-user-accounts-to-be-purged/">Inactive user accounts to be purged</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Pardon a small note regarding user accounts on our website. We have a handful of accounts that appear to be inactive. The user has never logged in and (therefore) has not personalized their profile. We imagine that a few of these could be users that made a error when registering and left an artifact when re-registering, since the ability to delete one's account was not originally available. We also were not originally moderating the registration process and suspect that a few accounts might be from the bots that left us the poetry last week.</p>

<p>To assist us in verifying active accounts, we would like to ask each user that has not logged in since registering or has not added their full name to your profile, to please take a moment to log in and do such. If these inactive accounts remain unused they will be purged.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help. We hope that you are finding the website useful.</p>
