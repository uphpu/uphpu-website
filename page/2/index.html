            <p>&quot;Everyone is talking about \&quot;Big Data\&quot; but it can be daunting to know where to start. Learn how to get started with Big Data in minutes using Google Cloud&#039;s BigQuery for extremely fast results. We will discuss how BigQuery can tackle very big problems in a cost effective with data sets ranging from gigabytes to petabytes. We&#039;ll show how to easily load data into BigQuery, execute ad-hoc queries through the Web UI, and how to programmatically manage everything with PHP. Using the GitHub.com dataset, we&#039;ll show analyzing 2TB+ of data in 30 seconds or less. So stop wondering \&quot;how can I collect all my data effectively\&quot; and start getting the most out of your data today.&quot;

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Everyone, I can't believe it, but this January will mark 10 years of UPHPU meetings! We're so excited, we're having a little bit of a special meeting for the occasion!</p>

<p>The meeting will be this Thursday (Jan. 16th) at Needle at 7:00 PM. It'll be Elizabeth Naramore from GitHub talking about "GitHub: More than Just Code." We will also me slightly modifying the after party location for this month, so read on for the details.</p>

<p><strong>Talk Summary</strong></p>

<p>"It's no secret that at GitHub, we use GitHub to write the code that runs GitHub. But what you may not know is that we also use GitHub to manage GitHub the company. In this talk, I'll show you practical ways that we use our own system in a non-code context. You'll learn how we track projects and to-do lists, discuss and collaborate on corporate policies, communicate news to a highly distributed company, coordinate events, update and collaborate on internal and external documentation, and even onboard new Hubbers. You'll come away from this talk with a whole new perspective on using GitHub."</p>

<p><strong>About Elizabeth Naramore</strong></p>

<p>Elizabeth is an author, speaker, mentor, and recovering PHP developer. She currently works on the Community Team at GitHub, and loves finding new solutions to old problems.</p>

<p>After Party:  Belgian Waffle &amp; Omelet Inn 9:00 PM</p>

<p>For this meeting only, we'll be moving the after party to the Belgian Waffle &amp; Omelet Inn in Midvale (details &amp; map: https://www.skiphp.com/mingle/waffle) I also believe that the food will be covered by Jared Smith from Blue Host, who is one of the original members from back in the day. :)</p>

<p><strong>Ski PHP</strong></p>

<p>You've all likely have heard that Utah is having it's first regional PHP conference, Ski PHP! (https://www.skiphp.com/) It is great to see how awesome our community has grown over the last 10 years, and that our user group is one of the oldest PHP user groups today. If you haven't had a chance to sign up to attend, I highly recommend you give it a shot.</p>

<p><strong>Meeting Venue: Needle</strong></p>

<p>The Meetings are still at Needle, their address is: </p>

<p>Needle Inc.<br />

<p>Talk Summary:</p>

<blockquote><p>
You've been writing unit tests for your PHP code, but how sure are you that they cover every line of code.  We'll go over generating code coverage analysis reports using PHPUnit so that you can see exactly how much of your code your unit tests cover.

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>This month's presentation will be a presentation on "Real-Time Data with Redis".Â It will be October 17th at Needle.com at 7:00 PM and then we'll be meeting at Applebees in Draper for the after-party.</p>

<p>Talk summary: </p>

<blockquote><p>
There are many fast data stores, and then there is Redis. Learn about this excellent NoSQL solution that is a powerful in-memory key-value store. Learn how to solve traditionally difficult problems with Redis, and how you can benefit from 100,000 reads/writes a second on commodity hardware. We'll discuss how and when to use the different datatypes and commands to fit your needs. We'll discuss the different PHP libraries with their pros and cons. We'll then show some live examples on we use Redis at work to handle large volumes of data that is constantly being updated. Time permitting we'll end with a live benchmark of Redis to see just how many Req/s we can do.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The speaker this time will be myself, Justin Carmony, and it'll be a trial run of the talk before I go to TrueNorthPHP and other conferences speaking on it.</p>

<p>See you there!</p>
