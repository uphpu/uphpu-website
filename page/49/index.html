            <p>If you feel like your team could be more efficient in getting work delivered and out the door, take a look at Mob Programming. Woody Zuill coined the term Mob Programming as &quot;a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer.&quot; We&#039;ll talk about the principles and techniques used in Mob Programming and how to get started with your team. We’ll also do a short hands-on example to help you get a feel for if you’d like to try it with your team.

                <p>If you&#039;ve been involved in development very long, you&#039;ve probably experienced some projects that ended up being painful and less successful than you wanted. I&#039;ve definitely had my share. Through good advice, study, and a large helping of trial and error, I&#039;ve also managed to have some projects that exceeded my expectations. I&#039;ve learned some lessons the hard way, and in some cases, stumbled upon some techniques that I think work really well.

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>It's that time of the year again when hackers of all types get together for their annual celebration of discoveries made throughout the year. We call this <a href="http://www.defcon.org/">DefCon</a>, and every year, new exploits in software and hardware are released to the public.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to attend the conference for my sixth year there (for the 15 years it's been held now) along with more than 8,000 other hackers at the Riviera Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. Presentations were given on about <a href="http://defcon.org/html/defcon-15/dc-15-speakers.html">120 different subjects</a> ranging from drive reanimation to international information warfare. More than $15,000 was raised to support the <a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>. Breakout sessions were held for two full days on both wireless WEP and WPA cracking as well as lock picking.</p>

<p>Contests are also held every year including the infamous Capture the Flag contest designed to find the best team of network and server security gurus that runs continuously from the beginning of the conference to the very end. Hacker Jeopardy provides a test of knowledge of both technical details as well as political and related events. More than 10 other contests are also run including WarDriving, Lock Picking, DefconBots (build an automated robot to accomplish a specific task in the shortest amount of time possible), and a Mystery Box Challenge (you have no clue what you're up against until the competition starts).</p>

<p>Highlights from this year's conference included:</p>
