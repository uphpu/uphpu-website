                <p>There are various access control models, each with a specific intent and purpose. Determining the ideal model for an application can help ensure proper authorization to application resources. Each of the primary models will be covered, including the MAC, DAC, RBAC, and ABAC Access Control models. Examples, challenges, and benefits of each will be discussed to provide a further insight into which solution may best serve an application. Application sensitivity, regulations, and privacy may drive which model is selected.

            <h2><a href="/blog/2006/03/20/codeigniter-the-php-answer/">CodeIgniter: the PHP answer?</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>We all like the productivity of <a href="www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> but most PHP frameworks don'tseem to be quite right&mdash;some are too complex, some not stable enough,some not supported by ISP's, etc.  I've now tried most of them and myconclusion was to follow the "stupidly simple MVC" series to just writemy own code in a simple way but with some structure.</p>

<p>But I  noticed several posters to that blog series mentioned<a href="http://www.codeigniter.com">Codeigniter</a> as a great way to go with sort of the same philosophy.And today it was mentioned on <a href="http://www.planet-php.net/">Planet PHP</a>.  So I checked it out today, Wow!&mdash;it is really, really nice.</p>

<p>CodeIgniter is quite simple, nothing we couldn't do ourselves butsomeone else has done all the coding.  It follows some Rails MVCmethodology, but in a much more simplified way.  And simple is reallygood because it gives flexibility which is the big advantage of PHP.CodeIgniter is very new, just released a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>For example, the main author is not finished with his active recorddesign so he only has support for MySql (and we usePostgrsql).  But the framework is so simple, I can work around that fornow with skipping the active record stuff and just using standard dbcalls.  (I can simplify that later when they finish the db architectureand add postgres support).  The new <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend framework</a> also takes the simple route too, and might also be a great answer but this approach seems even simpler.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com">codeigniter website</a>ï¿½they seem very professionalï¿½the documentation is very good (great movie tutorials).  Even the quality oftheir forum page is very good (apparently their cms product is verygood).  I'm initially really impressed by this.  I'm going to try it outtonight.</p>

            <p><a href="/users.php?mode=profile&uid=14">Mac Newbold</a> presented on PHP 404 handler scripts. "Running PHP with Apache has some definite advantages. One that I use frequently is using a PHP script as the 404 document that apache uses when a page can't be found. You can use it for many things. PHP.net uses it to run a site search, to try and find the page you were looking for. You can use it to create 'virtual' URLs, where one script handles requests for many different URLs and hands back dynamic content based on the page name. You can even combine it with things like GD to make dynamic images that are created on the fly for each URL."</p>
