                <p>&quot;Everyone is talking about &quot;Big Data&quot; but it can be daunting to know where to start. Learn how to get started with Big Data in minutes using Google Cloud&#039;s BigQuery for extremely fast results. We will discuss how BigQuery can tackle very big problems in a cost effective with data sets ranging from gigabytes to petabytes. We&#039;ll show how to easily load data into BigQuery, execute ad-hoc queries through the Web UI, and how to programmatically manage everything with PHP. Using the GitHub.com dataset, we&#039;ll show analyzing 2TB+ of data in 30 seconds or less. So stop wondering &quot;how can I collect all my data effectively&quot; and start getting the most out of your data today.&quot;

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Though it is slightly old news, I thought we should announce that we have a new website for UPHPU! The great thing
is that it is statically generate, meaning that it is very easy to have anyone contribute. All of the code is up on
<a href="https://github.com/uphpu/uphpu-website">uphpu-website GitHub repo</a> and you can easily create a fork, make some changes,
and submit a pull request.</p>

<p>While the new design looks awesome, I'm still trying to finish all of the little pages across the site. So if you have
some time, feel free to hit me up on the IRC channel and ask for any things that need to be done.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Justin Carmony</p>

about "Abstraction, Object Interfaces, Traits, Namespaces, and Dependency Injection: Cool Stuff in PHP."</p>

<h2 id="talk-summary">Talk Summary</h2>

<p>This presentation will focus on some of the really cool stuff in PHP that you may not know of or not know quite how to
use. There will be examples and discussion regarding abstracts, interfaces, traits, namespaces, and dependency
injection. Have you heard of some of these and always wanted to use them in your PHP application but didn't know where
to start? You will learn the benefit of each one and when to use them in your existing or new application. This will be
a perfect presentation to help you advance your skill-set to include these tools to make your code even more clean,
structured, and awesome!</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>The meeting will be this Thursday (Feb. 20th) at Needle at 7:00 PM. It'll be me (Justin Carmony) from Deseret Digital Media talking about "Mentoring Devs Into DevOps." </p>

<p><strong>Talk Summary</strong></p>

<p>"Lets set aside the buzzword for a moment and have an honest discussion about DevOps. There is the idea of putting more Dev into Ops, but just a crucial (if not more crucial) is getting your Devs to think more like Ops. Most developers have little to no experience dealing with production environments, and helping them add value to your DevOps efforts can be difficult.</p>

<p>"We'll discuss practical ways of mentoring Devs into more DevOps skills and responsibilities. We'll share past experiences &amp; ways to help your Devs gain more insight to the health of production. Ultimately, our goal is to help your Devs gain the skills to help your team achieve better application performance &amp; uptimes. Finally, we'll talk about how Salt can play a major role in increasing insight in your production environment for your Devs."</p>

<p><strong>About Justin Carmony</strong></p>

<p>I work for DDM, been involved with the Utah PHP Usergroup for about 5 years now, and I use PHP on a daily basis. Currently at work we operate KSL.com, DeseretNews.com, Ok.com, and many others.</p>

<p>The After Party will be at the traditional location of Applebee's in Draper. We typically head over there at about 8:30-9:00, so watch Twitter and we'll announce when we're heading over.</p>
