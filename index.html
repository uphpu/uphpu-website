        <div>
            <p>Though it is slightly old news, I thought we should announce that we have a new website for UPHPU! The great thing
is that it is statically generate, meaning that it is very easy to have anyone contribute. All of the code is up on
<a href="https://github.com/uphpu/uphpu-website">uphpu-website GitHub repo</a> and you can easily create a fork, make some changes,
and submit a pull request.</p>

<p>While the new design looks awesome, I'm still trying to finish all of the little pages across the site. So if you have
some time, feel free to hit me up on the IRC channel and ask for any things that need to be done.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Justin Carmony</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>The meeting will be this Thursday (Feb. 20th) at Needle at 7:00 PM. It'll be me (Justin Carmony) from Deseret Digital Media talking about "Mentoring Devs Into DevOps." </p>

<p><strong>Talk Summary</strong></p>

<p>"Lets set aside the buzzword for a moment and have an honest discussion about DevOps. There is the idea of putting more Dev into Ops, but just a crucial (if not more crucial) is getting your Devs to think more like Ops. Most developers have little to no experience dealing with production environments, and helping them add value to your DevOps efforts can be difficult.</p>

<p>"We'll discuss practical ways of mentoring Devs into more DevOps skills and responsibilities. We'll share past experiences &amp; ways to help your Devs gain more insight to the health of production. Ultimately, our goal is to help your Devs gain the skills to help your team achieve better application performance &amp; uptimes. Finally, we'll talk about how Salt can play a major role in increasing insight in your production environment for your Devs."</p>
