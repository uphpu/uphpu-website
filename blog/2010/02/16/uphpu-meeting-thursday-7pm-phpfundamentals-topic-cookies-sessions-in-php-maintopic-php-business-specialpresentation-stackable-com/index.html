            <p>For our <a href="/events">February meeting</a>, Daniel Crookston will give a mini presentation on sales techniques, Justin Carmony will present on cookies and sessions, and Xmission will give a special presentation on stackable.com.</p>

<p>mainPresentation - Sales 101: The Basics - Daniel Crookston<br />
An overview of a handful of simple sales techniques you can use to schedule more sales calls, win more contracts, and ultimately earn more money.  The skills we'll be focusing on include turning a cold call (whether incoming or outgoing) into an appointment, helping the people you meet with to feel comfortable giving you their business, and negotiating for a better price once they have agreed to purchase your services.</p>

<p>phpFundamentals presentation - Cookies & Sessions in PHP.<br />
For this month's beginners PHP presentation, the topic will be Cookies & Sessions in PHP.   The purpose of Cookies and Sessions and where to implement them into your website. We'll cover how to use them, as well as some common mistakes that new developers can make.<br />
Presented by Justin Carmony</p>

<p>specialPresentation - Stackable.com<br />
Xmission will be coming out to present to us on what stackable.com is and how it works for you.  They will be answering your questions.</p>

<p>About the Main Presenter:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Dan has been programming since he was very young, and programmed professionally for 7 years in PHP.  He realized pretty quickly that sales was going to be a big part of being successful, so he took some sales classes and did a lot of studying.<br />
Recently he took a full time sales position to get more experience in a sales-only environment and to have an opportunity to learn from people who sell full time.
