            <p>For our October <a href="/events">meeting</a>, Grant Shipley, from <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Redhat</a>, will be flying in from North Carolina to tell us about deploying PHP on ec2 using openshift, and a little about <a href="http://www.follw.it">www.follw.it</a> which is a site he created using Code Igniter, and why I chose PHP over Java for the follw.it site, despite being a Java developer for over 10 years.</p>

<p>Whether you have one or a million visitors accessing your web app, they are all going to demand a great user experience regardless of what it takes for you to deliver it. This invariably means quick page loads and fast response times every single time. When things go south, you just throw more hardware at the problem and increase your caches and buffers, right? Wrong. Toss in an infrastructure that resides on the cloud and now you've got a really interesting problem on your hands. I'll leave the marketecure slides at the door, this is a hands-on technical talk in which we'll deploy an application to the cloud and then turn up the heat by leveraging the right mix of elasticity and auto-sclaing.</p>

<blockquote><p>Grant Shipley is an OpenShift PaaS Evangelist at Red Hat focused on cloud technologies.  Prior to that, Grant was a Manager of Software Development with responsibilities over the www.redhat.com website and supporting infrastructure.  Grant has over 10 years of software development experience focusing on Java and PHP.  In his free time, he contributes to several open source projects including Media Portal and www.follw.it  as well as developing iOS applications.  Grant has been using Linux on a daily basis since 1994 and is active in the FOSS community.</p></blockquote>
