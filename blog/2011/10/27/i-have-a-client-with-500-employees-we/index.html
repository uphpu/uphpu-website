            <p>I have a client with 500+ employees-- we have been providing email services for them, but we have permanent white-listing problems on our server. They probably need at least 500 to 1000 email in-boxes with SMTP capability and maybe at least 100 megs of storage. They need a professional business solution (free google apps or plain old gmail are not options).</p>

<p>They have been getting mail through us for years, but its not working well. Our mail flows through an Exim server (WHM), and there's no whitelisting, and I don't think we even use SPF or DKIM. We can set all that up, but I'm not sure it will help. They might just need a 3rd party email service provider.... </p>

<p>I'm thinking of recommending google apps, but I think it's far more than they are willing to spend ($2500 per month unless they offer a volume discount). Fusemail and Fastmail seem to have potential, but I don't know anything about them (it looks like either would cost a few hundred per month or a few thousand per year).</p>

<p>Can anyone recommend a solution here? Setting up a Zimbra or Postfix server are probably not options because we don't have a sysadmin, and I'm too busy writing software for clients to spend time on something like that... I'm basically looking for a cheap, but reliable email service provider...</p>
